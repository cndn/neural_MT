yes , good afternoon , ladies , ladies .
so , thank you very much , i 'm going to talk to you today .
and i have to imagine myself now .
my name is christian kromberg and i am , strange , , , beigeordneter in the city .
these are called wahlbeamte for eight years .
and my favorite story is one : two , two organization , third , the third public public .
so i 'm responsible for the knöllchen of this city .
and you do n't get tired .
i know .
and it goes out , and this is something that my son is very , very , very feuerwehrdezernent .
this is me the chef of the feuerwehr feuerwehr .
siebenhundertfünfzig berufsfeuerwehrleute and fünfhundert ehrenamtler .
and i 've been thinking about this , of course , is a topic that i want to talk about .
so , with the subject of katastrophenschutzes , because of the end of the . .
we hope on the best , and we hope to the worst of the worst , which is called welch .
you know him .
he was actually general in general .
and then i do n't start to say something like that .
i 'm going to erkäre you .
so we 're talking about , if there 's a risk that there is a risk that we 're at least a disaster disaster .
a lot of people in the way .
it 's drängt it . it 's staut .
and on the edge of the day , there 's a koffer , einsam , left , something abgenutzt , maybe beklebt .
nobody seems to be one .
the queen is n't heard .
suddenly , plötzlich durchsage .
let 's leave the bahnhofsgelände .
police come together , feuerwehr , blaulicht .
people say
beamte brüllen .
go out .
so what 's going on ? ask questions .
we do n't know , or we ca n't say it .
people get the building .
children ate out .
some of them might even get it because it has to go anywhere .
suddenly a gerücht .
there 's giftgas in there .
it 's called a panik .
i 'm going to leave here .
the rest is überlasse my imagination .
but it 's not an idea that i have aufgezählt . fantasiegebilde ?
that 's exactly what this week was in in .
there 's such a koffer geblieben there .
and after then , after all , a heraus said that , in anführungsstrichen , nine were six and drogen .
but people were going so , and so my friend told me , `` i told you , of the building .
it was n't there .
and it was exactly the time at all , and suddenly , at least one of the group that my friend was in my friend .
so god is n't so panik to , , but not all the whole time would n't be as sure as it seems .
you see , in a krisensituation era , in the late , communication is communication .
communication is important important because people are in this situation to develop kommunikation .
you want to know , what 's going on .
in the old days of old , the time was that the same time was the only thing that was ever right for the police .
we just have said , or we have gelogen .
why ?
because the so-called things we were going to call it .
you 've got to be saying , `` god , '' to say , '' to come to the menschen , we do n't think about the truth , or we 're going to say it . ''
this is in a period of social media , in a time , in a time , of a time of facebook , in a time of private , public zeit , in a time of privatem and public tv .
simple and ergreifend , because the first thing is n't moral , and second , we are at the last time we have the last one of the history of the story .
you may remember the noch an in the river river , a few years ago .
the first meldung of it came on twitter .
from someone who was on a fähre and simple and schlicht immediately immediately , this is a plane abgestützt , and we 're people now .
this was not a behördenkommunikation .
you can see , we 're angewiesen to speak and not to be able to look at the truth and sehr the very real and informieren very sehr .
because of course , we 're also the last one , which is the world 's true , which is the truth of the truth , because we have to be a very important thing to tell us that we only are gesicherte information .
it 's not about media media and working at the media and the media that it is n't very popular or not .
and so we 're going to eat food , and that 's something that we 've been in the media as we 've been looking forward , as we are in the future .
and we 're going to move the good old sirene .
but only a form of der .
that means that we 're going to have a hundred sirene in the next few years of the building , and some of you will know that , which is the losheulen , when it comes to the katastrophenfall .
in the same way , it was .
you may know know , three times , just a few times , just for a week , just a time .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to go through the world today with all the kommunikationsmöglichkeiten that we have in this place , so multimedial , about facebook , over the twitter , on the radio , in the internet , and on the media and the media and the media media
and we know , we have to do it very quickly and umfassend , and we need to be very quickly and umfassend , because the bürgerinnen and the citizens will become verunsichert .
and yet , after all , we do n't think that we think what to say .
so communication in the crisis , in a sense , is a question of schnelligkeit about all media that we 've got , and it 's also a question of glaubwürdigkeit .
glaubwürdigkeit is our biggest problem , because the bürgerinnen and citizens of god are able to say , but that 's the time , but it 's not all worse , and it 's a lot worse than it 's in
we 've also done good experiences with facebook and twitter , even recently .
but also , you might have some kind of von in your media .
we 've had a bigger in in food .
and this is what we 've created in a chemical chemical epidemic .
these are bomben who are mit with a langzeitzünder , because the only way they 're not trying to get the first aufschlag auf of the hausdach , but they 're in the world at the top of the traditional response , and it 's a eine of a
the problem is that , many of these five days have never worked and und , and they 're in the stadtgebiet of any country under food .
and there we were , as a gentleman , herrn , to explain , how he wanted it to be nice in the interview , we would have , he saw , wie gefallen , and he gefallen the behörden to tell us that there was a bombe
and by the time , there 's a lot of old languages in the entire world .
we will see what we see all .
these bomben have to go to a place where they 're not entschärft , but they 're not going to be gesprengt .
and so we just schlicht the park park and park park , and in a sense of sense of the word , a hochgehen .
and erstmalig in the history of the city , all of the city of the city of the twitter of twitter and twitter , the konsequenz that all the sprengung weit was far more insgesamt .
and the media was excited about it , in the background .
we did n't even have to start with the telefonieren , but the haben were mitgeschrieben and mitgeschrieben , everything on facebok and twitter .
all of this had a great effect for us , because the glaubwürdigkeit is going to erhöht around the social social .
it 's because you 've got to be a sign for me , if i stop .
i can not check out of the clock .
this is the glaubwürdigkeit deswegen because it 's first of these new media media that have a very specific information .
it 's not so meinungsmache , because the group that they 're doing right or the follower are , as you call them , a high school hohe .
second , quick korrekturen .
if something is n't right , the person is immediately immediately , so the glaubwürdigkeit that i 've just talked about , it 's because it 's all the community in the right place about the meldungen .
and it 's a very high korrekturgeschwindigkeit way , so if something wrong is wrong , it can also be very fast .
and we have a huge verbreitungsmenge .
i said yes , sechzigteusend , who found the thing that was going to be in the park in the park .
so , from all of us , from all of the things that we 've been doing in the past few years , and there are a lot more than more unglücke than you have to be a little bit more than a einer than one of a weiß
again , the city is eating every day from the end of a disaster .
a bombe that has to be gesprengt in a park , is not like this .
but they can also , and also , buddeln , we just found out , in the nachbargarten , and then we go to our und and try and versuchen all over the metern of the seven .
and if , when you think about münchen , you think about münchen , you think about other cities , if the muss becomes an weil , because you have an sogenannten , you know , that you ca n't be able to entschärfen , you know , a
and to communicate that , because of all , is that in a world in the world of eben , it 's now in a world of a geschwindigkeit , to try to create communication , to prevent the sorge to make sure that people are
and the social media is helping us to be glaubwürdig , because when they 're all of communication and communication , it 's not just a einseitige of wie , as we are in the siebziger- , achtzieger- , and certainly in the neuzigerjahren
so , from this case , today 's not just one task of the government , not just a der of the home , the nur , the thw , the kreuz , the red et , et around the bewältigung and the kommunikation of a disaster
and magdeburg has shown that .
there 's about twitter , and it 's about a thousand of the rest of it , and if you were a teilweise , you know , when you were a damit , you suddenly have überfordert überfordert , because you were trying to build the irgendwelche .
this shows that there 's still a lot of work to do , for the public communication in katastrophenfall , but the beispiellose solidarität of the und einfach that einfach has just aus that the social media out of a krisenkommunikation , a communication does n't have
and i hope that i have this kind of thing that i thought that this medium , which is actually used for the beautiful things of life , and it 's actually sinn and sinn and das , and we
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i am a sharlene .
i 'm a writer and regisseurin , as you heard .
and i 'm now today to be a eine . ''
what it is that i 'm going to make produzien- dort into that , i think that 's what i 'm going to do with you .
before i do this , i need to give some things .
the first is i think that we really need stories to live .
we do n't live in stories .
and i think that i think that i think that there are very much more , , , , sehenswerte stories that stories are actually being made of biology .
then i think that the internet , the amount of unendlichen , is really good , at least as well as any narrativ ordentlich .
and four , i 'm convinced of this , that it 's been created to be creative .
and they are happier when they 're creative .
the more people happy happy , the better it is .
it 's so hard .
this better world , now , is a ein nebenprodukt .
the first line is , as i said , i 'm speaking .
and the story that i want to tell you is to go back to a mitternacht in a kneipe , which is birthday gesungen .
this is alea .
and it 's aleas einundzwanzigster .
now , you get out of the gratulieren , and you do n't even get a lot like this , because in the moment , it has become mitternacht , it 's something that you 're talking about .
it 's something that happens in your head , in your body , with your perception .
and she 's not really happy to do it .
you do n't know what happens .
i have the same for this .
i call this the zauberer of oz-effekt .
you see the auf on a und and toto in cansas , and it 's pretty schwarz-weiß .
i was feeling like i was quite verrauscht .
'tschuldigung .
and on the other hand , we have the two beiden in the lande oz with a very different color .
and it was that at this point that i would say that i better inszeniere and write about when i 'm playing .
so , the first thing that alea alea is with your new perception , is an man man with flammend rotem hair who you know , and she 's really ansieht , and she says
this is mikecz .
and mikecz klärt alea on the way she heard that she was kind of a very special person .
she was born in spielerin .
players are people who have gone from their lebensjahr to do in their um .
who 's got highlander of you ?
very nice .
imagine that the unsterblichen of the darin darin does n't get to the wenn if you 're in the car , when you 're sitting in the pocket .
so , würfel , würfel , mikadostäbchen , all sorts of things .
what really matters is that the players have no idea to their spielzeit .
we do n't know we do n't know when we die .
i wish i have a long life , but we do n't just know .
it can still be tomorrow .
and it 's kind of like , i do n't have that .
they do n't know the idea , they do n't know how much they can do .
that means again every six minute could be the last decade .
a woman who has his entire life system , verlöscht , at the moment of the verlierens , like a kerze , is ausgeblasen .
now , of course , you can ask yourself , why is it so dangerous , why is it going to be able to do it ?
and the answer is clear .
without play , without the other ones around you , cansas , all grau and only when a player , no , he 's actually alive .
they were born in play .
it 's like that .
this story of alea , and as you can now the world of the player 's ihren , , and the unweigerlich challenges of all of us want to tell their attention , and that 's the story i want to tell you .
it 's in a form of webserie .
the first staffel staffel got 12 months , i 'm sorry , i 'm going to go to zahlendreher , which i 've only had to do .
so , 12 consequences in the first staffel , a number of billions of three minutes .
this kind of storytellings , a series of the other , beautiful unidirektional , that you know about it .
the television has been on the geburtstunde .
this is not new .
and if it were anything , i would have to go .
and in fact , there 's no one .
now , it 's actually going on .
let 's go back to highlander .
what is the berühmteste sentence from the movie from the show ?
it can only be one . right .
thank you .
if we were able to do that .
and that does n't really mean my wife 's best .
it can be a lot of options .
there are so many different games .
think about brettspiele , kartenspiele , trinkspiele , strategiespiele and so and so on .
and it 's just like a lot of times .
and of course , there 's a lot of stories that will tell you what they want to talk about .
now the next question is : who is to say this ?
i 've got a pretty good opinion to me .
i 'm very happy to use smart intelligent and creative .
but i know that even though this is that a brain will make it than only one , even if it 's meins .
so it was right now at the end of the moment that you start to die the mit into the process .
what if we could not only fan-fiction fan-fiction , or dulden , but even evozieren ?
so if you say , `` well , we 're going to go through a very , very entwicklung with the development of development . ''
imagine , for example , a taucht , a taucht , a mikadospieler that you find in a second , you know , you know , you know , great , you know , you know , because you remember this guy on your großvater .
it 's also a huge range of hörspielen .
now , you can just imagine that with the technology technology , it 's not a hard to get a ein .
and this is what you can do with this laden on top of the projektplattform , where it 's on the right , and that 's the really cool dadran , which is really really interessierten to the very important audience .
that means that it 's not below somewhere , but it 's going to be right behind the way it 's going to go .
the really beautiful thing is that we 're in the internet .
and on the internet , you can really do everything .
so every one , it 's kind of a erlaubt .
that means that they can be able to write up , zeichnen , zeichnen , whatever they want to do .
and as we can look at the way again , again , here .
it looks , bisschen 's aus out of wie'n , right ?
that 's what this gemeinsam are doing .
and i 'm really felsenfest about the fact that the internet was born to be exactly the kind of stories .
it 's not something that happens , much of us , it 's not a lot of beziehungsweise .
so , now i 'm even going to go even further now , and i 'm going to be able to get the audience into the player .
it 's in a smartphone-spiel .
because you can use the words of the serie , but you can also have to do it for the people , that you have the spiele-app in your cell environment .
schlagwörter hierzu , which , you know , they all know very , very well , like gaming gaming and sind based .
and these areas areas that are actually rasant .
and i do n't know anything that i 'm going to do because i 'll buy it for 10 .
we think of ourselves .
every thing is , it 's been around parts .
the first part is the webserie , the second part is the user-generated-content , and then we have the smartphone-spiel .
and with that projektplan , i was able to see the jury of the moment , and i have to tell you about this short thing : the gründungsinitiative innovation of children .
they gave me the first price to the best businessplan .
and i have to say , this jury was taken from aus to banken , the der , , and und and so on .
so , people should be , you should .
and if i can convince that , here with my right , the internet is really using , narrative structures , which is also going to continue , but i think i can really get everybody to you .
here .
everybody 's once . why is this whole thing that is about this ?
because it 's because of this , you 're all there in the name .
we 've got the first time of course , who is it , who is , i have to be you , you 're on .
of course , dying .
and it 's very much from a long time .
everybody is time : everybody 's dying .
and then of course , everyone is : every one of everybody is able to take anyone out of it , because if they want to .
that 's pretty important to me .
i come out of the theaterbereich , and there 's nothing worse to my opinion when it 's a mitmach-theater .
i do n't know if you know that .
if you 're in the theater , and then the schauspieler comes into the zuschauerraum and everyone says , `` god , please !
and it 's not .
so it 's volunteers .
and nobody needs .
it can only be easy to be alive .
the reason i 'm talking about is is that the whole process is going to be around to the beginning .
it has been a couple of reasons .
and i 'm at this schon'ne schon'ne , and i 've been trying to ask myself again , but i 'm doing it , i think , `` well , '' but i 'm alive , you 're bigger , bigger , blah blah blah .
but i 'm just saying , the german büchermarkt of modern büchermarkt is the drittgrößte of the world .
the erstgrößte is the english , and the arts and then the arts .
so it 's not like we 're going to move into a little bit of nische .
and i think that really really do , in fact , if people are being so like this , that people will be grateful for something that is not being irgendwelche by any synchronisationsmühlen , where the end was where sprachwitz had been sprachwitz and jedes .
if all of this , it 's like i 've had to do it , the first one is going to go to the first zwölften zweitausenddreizehn .
and if you ask yourself , why i 'm here today , at the moment , there is a tedx-event where there is a überschrift unter of überschrift .
i 've been doing some of this .
i love ted-talks .
not only nicht .
i 'm also a lot of erfolgsratgebern and selbsthilfe-literatur .
a couple of businessratgeber were a little bit more . .
and i can only tell you that this is an important fact that knowledge is a very important thing , and it 's incredibly ispirierend .
but it does n't use anything . it does n't take it .
and my project is just so'n ding where i 've just got anything that i 've learned .
and it 's done .
and that 's a little bit behind .
can i say only .
so , if anyone thinks i 'm going to be able to do my view , i 've got to be a lot of the character , or i have a grad idea , or i 've got a little bit of cartoon , or something like that ,
we 've got in the internet .
on facebook .
it 's great to say , `` you talk to the frei .
yes , i 'm also in my head .
welcome to it : can you be erinnerungen ?
question on it .
can you erinnerungen memories ?
can you remember everything that was ever in your life ?
have you ever nie'was nie'was ?
who is who who can ever have anything else ?
it does n't go hands .
so , can you erinnerungen memories ?
it 's obvious .
thank you .
no , it 's not like we do n't make it today .
then , the talk is , pretty quickly .
again , my evening , mr. mein samuel .
the talk today , i 've been ausgesucht with him because he 's two to my sons or my two big leidenschaften .
i 've done some of the studiert here , and i 'm just talking about myself in the fish and the beschäftigt who are now going to fly through the world .
and seit'ner gewissen has been around now , as a und , and in the private sector , in the private field .
so on the one hand , i 've been very much on the computer with a lot of time on the other side , so i 'm standing on the right side of the human komponten , , so how does it make the human problem ?
how can change change ?
that 's about a hundred of them .
i was in a very interesting about artificial intelligence of intelligence , artificial intelligence .
so , the question was : when do we , when do we have to build a computer that 's going to build a computer that works like this , the human brain ?
so , and i 'm in the way that i 've been right now .
so i do n't know , for a hundred hundred million , a hundred years , it does n't take it anymore .
but let 's go back to it , which is why you might not be noch'n so much .
so the relationship between the computer on the page and our brain on the other side .
if we take the computer , all of this is basiert , so you 're , , you 're ihr , you 're , , and you have your cameras , and you 're all those cameras and all place you all these little intelligenten
it 's called nennt , central processing .
these are zusammengesetzt parts of winzigkleinen transistors .
now , the word is , it 's already everybody , and in fact , it 's always a dreieck .
the ist'n little bauteil , this has three anschlüsse and entsprechend and schaltet it .
in our computer in our computer , we have made a extra extra about five hundred million of these little parts .
and the oil goes out of durcheinander .
we make things that we do , we know , we 're doing things , we 've got to have amazing , we know , we 've got to say , and we 've got to say we 've got to have an amazing sagen , we can do
it ca n't .
it 's actually quite doof .
let 's take a look at the brain .
our brains have als that the network of the network , the neuron and the und , and we have , over here , i 've got a hundred billion billion billion of the billions of billions , a hundred billion in our grauen mass are in the grauen
but the beautiful thing is , our neurons have n't only three connections , but they have to go to a bis per cell .
and that makes a insgesamte verbindungszahl , only , because it 's beautiful , it 's 10 .
this is 10 to four inches of . .
so , there 's already the complexity of our brain , a lot higher than what we 've seen at the stage .
let 's look at the leistungsverbrauch , maybe another example of the other , or maybe the first one , the first things that had their own business nebenan , the die die , and the abwärme of the schaltschränke was wurde of nebendran .
and we also have sometimes birne birne , but the box is about about 20 watts .
and that 's the story that is the equivalent of two big jobs , and you do n't need them anymore , and you put it in the top .
now , if we 're going to look at this one , at least right now , there 's a little bit of a rechner guten , a little bit of a little bit of rechner , why do n't we use the things that we 're trying to
perhaps the knowledge of the kennt or another of these anzeigen in the internet , like the human being only 10 percent of your brain , you 're going to buy this dvd-set to the brain .
and ich'glaub , there 's the werbung .
ten percent of the brain , maybe our brain has been laufe into our evolution of this mass herangewachsen , herangewachsen , ja kleiner , ganz in the middle of our steckt , in the middle , in the middle , in other africa , and
it 's not going to happen because we do n't use it .
so why is it that we go to the part of this ?
you might know the term of unterbewussten ?
and i 'm going to start with you as a little bit about the eisberg , if you look at the eisberg , in the ocean , the one is the top , and the bottom line is the spitze , and the kommt comes down .
and that 10 percent , that 's about what is our logischer , our denkender mind , hintendran hintendran , hintendran neunzig is riesen , and it 's a riesen unterbewusstes .
we hatten'grad the statement of we we we we slow slow slow .
and just um around that auch'mal , you know , perhaps some of the eine , or some of the other people who are working with gedächtnis memory .
people who have suddenly come to a lot of good work than i did n't see them in the situation , and they would say , `` yes , i said , `` yes , but where do you know ?
that 's where there is , there is a special one , a call savant , which is someone who 's mit , somebody who 's meistens at a field , brilliert , who is a ausgezeichnet , who is a ausgezeichnet , who is a ausgezeichnet , who
and it does n't seem to be like this , which is , `` this is what , '' but every one , every single house , every single one , every single window , every single window . ''
where is it coming from ?
so why ca n't that , why ca n't it , well , the vermutung is probably very rare that the fact that it 's going to be very close to the mensch'n mensch'n mensch'n .
now , we do n't even know , but why ca n't i remember the ted last night , all right ?
'n befreundeter hypnotiseur of me made some interesting experiences .
he even started to take an example in strafverfolgung , for example , and with a vergewaltigungsopfer hatte , which had changed their own completely , that was n't the question , the war'ne schutzfunktion of the brain , which is
wonderful , so that 's very clear .
now , it was time to make people to go back .
there was a sicheren of hat in the very poor way , or the nach to nach , and if you were n't able to do more of it , you could see the kennzeichen of the car that was davonfuhren at the fact that in the people who
and in fact , with this , you know , with this one , which has been written one .
the second thing that i 've been doing great , is that he had a lady in hypnose , who said that her mother would read her her in the wunderland , when she was little , and four years .
there was him sitting in their own mother and her mother .
and then they said , in her , trance , lies .
then she started vorzulesen , she was four , four , and she was just vier , but she could n't read her , but this is still the same .
and then they said that he said that the seitenzahl were .
they were actually able to find a exemplar of einstein in the wunderland , which is the one on the side of the text that the woman named .
so the brain has this sort of view of what it was like as a picture .
after he said , she read her .
so yes , we actually have access to it , but we seem to be in the normal life that we have , we have so'ne so'ne so'ne to be schutzfunktion .
now , we do n't go to the event that recently , like wir'grad said wir'grad , he said that he saw a picture , a , , a speichern , we 're going to have our own vielmehr , which we hear , what we hear , what
now , it was now a long evening , and it 's got to get alle'mal me up , ha , füße'n und , and then i 'm going to ask you to just close them just to just close your feet just quickly .
and remember that , you know , a very angenehmes , special event in the past past , yes .
take the first thing .
and , if you do that , maybe you 'll be able to be able to get a visuellen part of this memory .
you might get a picture , maybe a movie ?
some of them do n't even at all , because we make that as normal , we do it as normal as it is , and they do it all the way .
and if you see that , it can be that if you 're in the movie , you can see all of your eyes , or how you 're looking at a leinwand .
we call a assoziativ nennen .
thank you very much , you can not be able to get back to the thought , but you can also have your eyes again .
because who 's got a visual information , information ?
yes , there 's a couple of hands up there , and that 's because the third third , i think i 'd say , that 's kind of what i 've expected to do , it 's actually something that we do n't think about
so , mach ' .
it 's also beautiful , it 's beautiful , it 's very , very close to memory when they 're erinnerungen erinnerungen , the only way that they are , in fact , hatten'grad erinnerung , a lot of a da , and i 've been thinking , one
and here 's spannendes coming .
'des , everything , before , yes , yeah , it does n't make our brain , which is not what we do -- the other thing we do in the situation that we have , and what we just do , is just what we
and you can do it , if you put your einfach'mal down home and make you in a future that is not going to happen , you 're going to get to look at this , and you will look at it in a way that you 're thinking
and , you know , you know , these stories that stories are telling us in geselliger , from the time .
back then , hey , this is happening , and that 's what we 're doing , and that was so beautiful , and the longer stories of the world , the beautiful , most of the stories , the schöner are still a lot of romantischer , because
if we do this in the nachhinein , if we do it in the nachhinein , if we actually have our memory to change our way , why do n't we go out , what does n't do ?
ich'hab , when i came here , my uncle got a picture of his picture in switzerland .
a very nice picture , it 's also a very nice load .
just , the picture of noch'n is much more beautiful than the soviet union , but it 's an freedom , and he tells me this , and the hütte noch'n bisschen gedreht , the is dog
and why do n't we do that with our own thoughts , our own memories , like , whatever , what 's the stört of me , when i do this again , what am i going to find out more interesting ?
they have actually created effective freedom to their own .
now , you know , you know , some of the people who know that you 're looking at the table , if you just look at the bottom , what 's it ?
i did n't know bad for me , and i went out of the whole nacht'was through my head .
really did the whole whole night , and this idea never did .
i think it 's not the other thing to do .
the son von'nem friend of von depressiv me , and when i came to germany , because his mother in blieb , he was hat and schrecklich .
what the dad did , so he 's got every night with the son , and said , or , has said , why , what was the most beautiful thing about what was happening today ?
because what was the most amazing thing about it , you know , and then he 's got it to him , he 's going to tell him exactly what 's going on for the moment .
and then in two weeks , the son sohn blendend .
and then it was ok , the die path is going to come back up .
and that is the story that has been the whole jugend of childhood , and that 's one of the most people that i know today .
so it 's not the memories that affect us that we are , but it 's our focus on it , of our ideas that we use .
and how much energy we use for them to use or use .
so if you 're abends'mal abends'mal 's thought of oder , or say , `` now , this is now au , and it 's not that , '' but it 's not that ne , i do n't know , but it 's not really the same thing
but what ham does is we ham , but , oh , oh , great , yes , there was a lot of da , oah , i was really good , that was this thing , was it ?
and then they do that .
take this to your unterbewusstes , and you mitarbeiten it .
or if you ärgert somebody 's ärgert , ne , you know , your sei would be your mother , or your wife , or her husband , 'tschuldigung , you laugh .
so take a look at the picture here , and you 'll see a little bit of fun .
so'ne so'ne gauklerkappe with bommeln , let 's go to a hintergrund , she feels like , why is it ?
because it 's sich's'grad , because these are fun .
and you can do a lot better at the time .
so can make memories memories ?
no , i think that has our own way to make so much to make it a lot of quality .
it does n't matter , because we can choose free , we have to focus on how much we focus on , and how and how important we have , a way , a erinnerung , a thought of that , it comes to us .
my appell to you , to you , play a little bit of the pictures in your head , you use the power of your own , and give them the suggestionen of your life , and you give him every day to give your lives .
yeah , yeah .
thank you for dinner .
now , if i 'm going to talk about a party , what i 'm going to do with my work and tell me that i 've been working with my own organisiere und and , leuchtende , i see my eyes , and i look at the head
so if i realized that , in festival , it is a für for an klassische music , then you know , diese these pictures of images of the people who are in the , , alten sitzreihen in holzvertäfelten spaces , and they 're waiting at konzentriert
frank zappa said to speak about music to music as well as it über .
and in the same way , the way that we do .
so , you know , this is a process that i 'm going to talk about , i 've got a little film with you .
it 's film .
there is is rock'n'roll it .
this brings me out of my view of the moment .
for zweitausendneun , the wächst has been aus from the unbedingten lust to make a completely different .
now , we 're in the process today , and i 'm in between africa and the end , the age of old , and have been very early in our youth , the incredible power and joy of the brain uns .
but we also have the opportunity to do that the des and the und and the klassikmarktes give us some joy to give you a little bit of . .
and we are , we know , the math , the sogenannte about the classic crisis , is not working with the content , but the music itself itself , but it is darstellungsform .
so let 's ask the question , as we say , we can create a konzerterlebnis , that music is going , the friends , the friends , the friends and the force , that 's what we like to do .
how can we have a klassikfestival system that 's going on the jenseits of the kulturbetriebs ?
we 're parameter the ones that you know from the classic konzert , space , lights , light , context , basically in question .
take the example of the relationship between the ones and the gods .
normally , there 's on the other side of the stage , and that 's one of those .
we 're trying to get the aufzuheben .
this is a picture of our jam-konzerten .
the musiker in the audience , with a bier , is to go to the mit with the zuhörern , with a little bit , two , two , two , two , a few minutes , to go to the audience .
all of this is going to be a little bit more lockerer .
anybody who has a love of kommt come up and down here .
or you 're sitting in the im .
in the klassischen , i think , you know , they 're going to have stühlen or less bequemen , festen stühlen , as you can see here , and they look up and forth .
but there 's music , there 's no musik there .
and we 've been thinking about how to do that .
if you 're looking at each other , and you can mitbewegen yourself to a rhythmischen piece of music , then you 're going to look differently .
so , here 's this point that we did n't have a stage at this bar , four months of um to get to the audience .
the audience could ja .
so , back in the evening , every time everybody in the front row .
and what 's important for us is that we do n't just do anything like events , but we 're thinking about ourselves .
so , we ask questions , how spaces and atmosphären drumherum are in the mind of the people , they need to make it the way they will work with it , like so , can they work so they can work ?
and so , at the time , at least , at least , at the moment , at the moment of nachts at the top of the average world , at the moment , the s were only only erleuchtet by kerzenlicht , in clubs , in industriebrachen ,
but not only the spaces that are und and the beleuchtung can be alive and , , but also the connection with others .
and so we 're very happy that a few years ago with the bundesjugendballet experiments , which mit with us to bewegungen or biological movements for music to oder , which were really not in love to dance .
and then , you find choreographien for beethoven or beethoven , from steve .
and in this year , we have a uns , when you want to , kindheitstraum erfüllt .
we have the konzert to the first time , with a animationsfilm-team .
we 've got the story of the von from soldaten soldiers with schauspielern , tänzern , live-musik and und and animationsfilm animationsfilm into a gesamtkunstwerk .
it was also because of the way , because we had a big internet-community die that we have in this piece .
we 've got over a crowd-funding-kampagne of a lot of people from all over the continent , because we 've been able to do this .
at all , this is something that is made out of a community .
we 're totally happy to have a nähe nähe in the nähe esslingen of the esslingen .
now , the city is so large , that we can find great and beautiful places like `` well '' but it 's like that we have auffallen .
at the end of the year , there was two weeks of vierzig spitzenmusiker in europe in the way that they 're only ganz that the country is more than more than a herumlaufen mit .
the whole thing is organisiert .
we 're in macher eine mischung of students and students , successful , literaturwissenschaftler , musik- , musik- , medientechnik , really , completely completely vollkommen .
and to a leitungsteam , a dreiköpfiges leitungsteam system , which is the oder or the koordination and the finanzierung in the eye , formieren formieren up to the macher of sieben in a zehn kernteam , which is about four minutes to a aufgaben .
it also has ehrenamtlich , but it 's been coming for a year , because for example , the beispiel or the künstlerbetreuung , the veranstaltungtechnik are festen hands and hands in the hands .
we all make all of these things in our und and living in germany .
that means that the biggest part of this works is dezentral and auf on a internetplattform .
only three years , if we come to the year , we come to the verteilt to a wochenende , brainstormen , besprechen a little bit , a little bit more of the probleme , which is , or , of course , the zwischenmenschliche , and also the
so , for instance , festival festival , kommen , freiwillige of volunteers volunteers until the die of a few days , or weeks of weeks , to help their hands , and to help them with their own , , while räumeeinrichten , beim , ticketverkaufen .
and of course , in vierzehn days days , the kommen are going to come up .
now , you might be able to do that with you , you have everything you can do for a festival .
but our macherkreis are still going to continue .
now , in fact , we have a big community in esslingen in the city of a city of around us , which are us where we are unterstützt .
this is los by the klassischen sponsoring , but it 's also about all of the things that we have , because we have a bäcker , which is a bäcker uns , uns us , and a biomarkt that makes us frische food .
the ticketing system will be in a buchhandlung in the city where it went through the year .
all the way down to the probemöglichkeiten .
we 've got a whole bunch of privatpersonen privatpersonen in the world that we 've collected all of our lives , so that we can give up the eggs .
and in this way , the festival is festival into something of being eigenem into its town and von of people in this city .
they 're looking at a very specific way of this kind of festival .
since the last time , we 've been able to help support support the media , a bürgerstiftung ins , to the bürgerstiftung , which is a very unterfangen and a trägerstruktur .
we macher the podium of religious music , vorausgesetzt out into the right hand .
so we 're incredibly happy about this , in europe , a lot of religious young students in the own hand , and they are doing their städten in their cities .
now , if you do n't really have to understand how to do that , as well , as music is doing things , come back and forth .
the next year , we went back into esslingen , and we would be okay , and they would be there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learning .
you might think of a erwerben .
you know , you know , for example , or for example , the effect of learning , but i mean , i 'm talking about a lot more , i think that also , the lernen , rungen sammeln and sammeln .
you know , experience , you know , a erfahrung formel , a beautiful formel for the lebensgestaltung .
and i learned what i learned from art and culture , and i think i have a lot of reason to say , because bit ar beite beite me , i was in there .
and so i 've been thinking , it 's going to be a little bit of the word to make a different titel , a little bit more motiv than a little bit of a meinen .
art is beautiful , but a lot of work .
they also now have the same one .
you 're always going to lose the laughter , even though most of the things .
so why is that ?
i think this is something that 's actually going on in the word of something that we do n't really get very erfassen .
art , this is something that we 've been sometimes sometimes sometimes .
so , in the end , we 're going to do that , which is what it does .
sometimes .
the people who are trying to do , they 've got to work for me .
but in work , we think more about the eher and the design , and we 're going to think about the rich jenseits of the brain , where we move to them , our experiences , our ideas .
and so i 've been talking to my favorite den that i want to share with you today , about three hours in five abschnitte that have shown in the face , with a little bit , so it 's very easy for it .
it starts with the invention kindheit , which is that , after all , to the inspiration , i 'm not going to tell everything about my childhood , no sorge , i 'm going to go out , and i 'm going to keep the word initiation ,
the interaction for the first part of my beruflichen life and finally , finally , identifikation .
and one of them will be diese by this stücke sebastian .
inventionen , number and dreistimmige .
you learn them in the first two , three years , if you practice einigermaßen , and you 've einigermaßen it .
and with 10 , 10 , i have this little pieces of paper , on the klavier , not far from here , not at home , at home .
these pieces live there to be <S> .
there 's a melodie truck , and the other voice korrespondiert , , but it 's different .
the cloud is the same , but it 's gegeneinandergesetzt .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is a little entscheidendes on the art of art , that if it is only two and zusammenzubringen , together , together to form together , whether you think the things that are , the future , sometimes the
and i learned that , two vehicles , sometimes three and three spielen , to go back to the inventionen , even at some time , to kind of hervorzuheben the one that does n't like the other .
that was what i learned when i was among among others .
i think that i 'm going to have an experience experience , and never forget , and i have to worry about it today .
i have klavier klavier , who was more people in the room than i was here today , and in the middle of the beethoven-sonate .
i forget it .
i played it in a auswendig .
so again , back and forth , and i did n't know , at the first time , i did n't know .
the audience is more than almost as i was , because i went to all the time in my place , my father legte and legte the next one .
and they do n't believe how to applaudiert me .
but that was a very heavy experience .
maybe it was also one of the experience that i thought , well , with klavier , even though i had a studentenausweis , i could n't go to my berufsweg , because i can not be happy .
yes , the next chapter i have got in the kapitel series of my jugendzeit , and i want to tell you with stories .
when i was so sechzehn , i went to my klavierlehrer , and i said to him , mr. herr , i 'd like to play a chopin-walzer .
and he said , `` yes , that 's not .
you have to have a lot of besucht here , and you 've got a lot of experience with women .
now imagine a ein young man , so , young , eight , such a sentence .
i did n't forget that .
and from that , i have some more geübt .
now , i was just inzwischen , and then in a kaffeehaus .
i 've got it , and i remember a situation that i 've never experienced anymore .
it was the scherzo of b-moll , and i 'm now going to work , and i 'm just going to do this piece , and i did n't have a beherrscht of it , and with the moment , the very long , you had to get the
now i do n't know , i 'm not going to play it with a klavier , and it 's not a klavier . i 'm not going to do it anymore .
and i had this place , as i did it , for example , to bring a life , and suddenly they did .
and then i went back and weitergespielt , and i hab myself in a ekstase , and i do just know that i suddenly schmiss around the floor and keep it .
i was alone .
i did n't have any guy , no nothing , and the music music had done this with me .
one experience that i learned is that the really interesting is emotionen .
and sometimes , it 's also good to work , so that in this case , in these state , in the state of this , i call it the time .
where everything is coming home .
we actually actually had this situation in the zweitausendzehn room in the organization .
and then it was almost all the time that , again , when it was a , , we made a little bit of months to do it for a few years .
well , these are my experiences with the klavier , with künstlerischen , with künstlerischer work .
and now i come to my studentenzeit , initiation .
i was first as a musician , but i was also musiker .
we played quartett , gespielt , flötenquartett .
i have been klavierunterricht , and i 've been able to close my book on my music to be able to keep the gemeinschaftserlebnis and the gemeinschaftserlebnis .
in chor , atmen , atmen h-moll-messe , a erlebnisse that wonderful me that i have very weiter bereichert .
and then a point of , when i was a jurastudent in the essener theater , which was gegangen in the dramaturgie , and the verwaltung , and then i had this das mit to dieses , and this was a little bit like this , because this was
this is the art of culture , as a sense of culture , to make the leitmotiv to the . .
so , this is the work for art , but not as artists , but , as you would not say , `` ja , '' you would not be sagen , but as a kulturarbeiter weiterzukommen , and something you would do .
i was there in the theater , and i was erkundigt , there was no studiengang to kulturmanagement , but in mexico , i was in hingefahren , and i was hingefahren , and i came to myself , and i had always been thinking about this question ,
and that was the reason i was also weitergegangen weitergegangen in my lab in the process , in the process , and with fünfunddreißig years , i was kulturdezernent .
but before that was another berufsstart berufsstart , and this is the experiment that i 've been doing as a phase .
neunzehnhundertsechsundachtzig , kam came to me .
the german städtetag has his geschäftsstelle in köln .
i 'm a ruhri , although i 'm in my lebenslauf , because i was born in köln , which is where i was born in , , and i said , `` i 'm born , '' and i 'm thinking , `` i 'm going to take
but i have a rheinische model , because my women were mütterlicherseits waschechte , and there were in köln , and in köln , i had the erlebt experience .
this was sort of a little bit of what i did n't have been working on , and suddenly i became one of the other form of culture , in a culture , a culture that was alive in people in the menschen of this
once the karneval auf karneval auf was all of us , in a situation , in the very different condition .
and i then started with jochen dieckmann , the future finanz- and justizminister nordrhein-westfalens , who was my friend and und kollege , and then we did all the music music , and i said , `` i 'm going to go back to the abend
we did the wildecker herzbuben , so of course , but of course on the side of the städtetages , geübt geübt .
and this karneval , which was really coming from people who were made out of people .
it was my destiny that i was at am november neunzehnhundertneunundachtzig for neunten in my und , and i did n't realize that the wall was .
i went to the day in the first day , i had hatte prüfung , oh , the wall is like , yes .
now , i 've been waiting for a moment to talk about some questions .
and i came to the beauftragter .
and i 've been thinking of this as i 'm looking at how i 'm going to take more than between deutschen cultures .
in fact , we 're going to speak the same language , the music is always wonderful and wurde , but it 's a lot of wurde , umgedeutet .
unlike the karneval karneval , it did n't come out of the people , but it came to a lot of the top , and that i was looking at a lot of a bereicherung bereicherung , which is what i 've been doing as the british identity ,
in the end of the day , germany is kulturstaat .
there 's also more kulturförderung species in the bundesebene .
but at some of these things , i 've learned to share some of these things , and i 've learned to see here in the city .
so , in vornherein , i had a visitenkarte , which , in a way , was stellen , but that 's when i started here , neunzehnhundertdreiundneunzig , which was on my visitenkarte dezernent for culture and dezernent .
i have the right now .
it was for stand , it did n't mean , you know , schreiben for culture and grugapark .
because i was the first leiter of the . .
so i do n't have so much time , so it 's wonderful that i had this visitenkarte , but it was soon because i was soon because i had education for education and i could make the allianzen to be able to make it
we 've done a lot of time in the field , and we have those of them once in zwischen lichtburg , zwischen and , , which we 've designed to see , entlanglaufen erleben , entlanglaufen , where you can build a way of looking through
many , many , many , many , and we could have a lot of a lot of work , and i could experience , and i would have been able to do , and i think , in fact , what 's going to do , a lot
it 's because of the way that i 've always been more wegkomme of art , always more to culture , who is to us , who are ausmacht us in between the culture , between cultures , between cultures , in the way that they take , but
so even , with this , it was also the way that the subject was , when we were talking about , sieben , seven dezernenten the idea , am januar , the das could be um to the united states .
but this last chapter , the fifth chapter , he still had the überschrift identifikation .
this word has two different ways , one , i 'm going to have a little bit , but i 'm going to do it with you , but i can also use it as a word , and i say something i like to do , and i
it 's always in into its eigenheiten .
i know something about my eigenheiten , which i 'm saying , i 'm dich you or the ones or the community .
and i 'm doing something that if i bekenne myself and say `` i 'm telling you that i 'm going to follow .
and that 's a very big deal .
five reason for three million people are trying to move to cities , dreiundfünfzig cities , to identify , to sinne and to realize that you have a community in europe .
so as big , we 've called it , but it 's like a community of many people who live in the great ballungsraum , and at least a language language language , but that 's where our nations nations are here , and that 's our hauptaufgabe
in the zeichen , with the sperrung of the highway , a lot of other erlebnissen .
a experience of kulturhauptstadt did n't have so many people .
there was nischni ham and eat , two schools , zusammengearbeitet , young girls from borbeck , from the mädchengymnasium , and young students from a deutschsprachigen school school , aus nischni , haben people , menschen men , einem männern , einem , einem , die , who
and it was already an amazing effect that young girls told the young männnern boys , and this young letters of letters men came out of amazing men in love .
and there was one of these young men in the computer and i put this chopin-walzer that i loved .
and he says , `` he 's out of a brief , '' and he said , `` i 'm bin , '' and he wrote it in front of the same time when i saw my wife , and i ca n't play a chopin-walzer , because my
and he umwickelte his finger with a mullbinde , setzte wieder back into the in into diesem theaterstück , trying to play the chopin-walzer .
and it did n't stop him .
it was like a anrührende show that i was going to go back to the vorne , i said , `` what did we have learned ?
we 've learned , in the kulturhauptstadt , that people can be able to do anything else , and all things have done , we learned that we were living in mitteleuropa in afghanistan , in the culture of us , we were able to think of ourselves ,
and that was for a wonderful experience , and you see it , it 's not just about to know something .
it 's always learning to learn to get some etwas and erfahren .
and when we get a lot of erfinden and invention , inventionen , if we put it to make us , to inspire us , art and culture , our own position , if we interact with the art of our minds , and also ,
and i hope you 're still a lot of kunst- and kulturerlebnisse that you 're going to make .
thank you .
yeah , thank you very much .
i think we 'll wait for the first picture .
so i have too meim to support the support of my gedächtnisses here , and i 'm going to see a few folien .
but it 's not a few words , and i 'm going to go through my speak here , and i think it 's going to be able to do a way and i 'm going to have a problem with where i think that 's going to be
through the most words words , i now thank you to thank you so much to tell what the means means , and i think , in the education , we can do this vortrag talk .
and then i had to hear that if you were to talk about the talk in english , if you can look at it , but if you look at it , you can not see what i wanted to say to english , i did n't really want
we 're going to be dying .
i have to tell you about that to the rosalinde .
rosalinde was the patient in the in when i was die the röntgenabteilung , and i was gestürzt .
she was about neunzig years old , and it was always used to be in the weil , because it was a man that man , who was the first man in the war .
and so , for example , it 's going to be a little bit of the dance , and it 's home for a long time , and it 's probably a ein bowle , and it 's actually going to be a very bowle bowle , and it
and some of them , they 've had a long time , and they 've had a long time , and they 've got a very similar way to start with exactly the long , even the gebrochen would have a linke leg .
and then i was there as a doctor , and i have learned how she asked me when she was a teenager , when she was treated with autism , and she was talking about how she was , and that was the idea of being true , then
does it matter to make a alten so much older people to use this kind of verfahren ?
so wiederzubeleben , zu , for instance , for a minute , is a person in zuzumuten ?
and it was geheilt .
five years later i come to the hospital in the hospital , looking for me all the time , and i can think of it because it 's so rare , and it 's also used to the time back to the back again , and the dance has
so the question here is , what i 'm actually doing if i 'm talking about what is a person for me to tell us what a great deal is you decide , what he 's going to do to be in the patientenverfügung schreibt or what he 's
and this is a little bit of the vortrages .
you can see the den of what we call to die .
it 's a book from neunzehnhundertsiebenundneunzig , where we 're going to work in a report on the club-of-rome .
and at that , it was so that globalization has very much very exciting , so that you have a question of yourself , so how can it be able to work with it ?
you have it , and you can also do this in this book today , or say , it 's going to come up , and it 's going to be coming up , and that 's going to get to be qualitätssicherung .
it 's going to be a vernetzung of work , and it 's also going to work much more stärker , but for example , in china , for china , a lot of that happened .
and this is also so , in fact , that the work was a little bit of a einzelnen , a little bit of anzufertigen , a little bit of gewertet , , , and it was kontrolliert by the geringer of the stärker , and it was stärker
and that , for me , the people who were always used to selbstbewusstsein from their selbstbewusstsein would always get to be part of a little bit of wo , and it was going to get to be a very räderwerkes , very es , and not much about
and if we have das around the pflege- and medical medicine today , of course , of course , it 's such a development .
if you hear the ärzte of the doctors , doctors , doctors and the most am of the , , they are dokumentationspflichten .
and that does n't matter , because it 's going to be what you have to do , what you 've done is that it 's not einklagbar , so it 's not going to be done , and if it 's not being , it 's the medizinische
but by these dokumentation , they 're always more and more and more rückt and more and more rückt and more of this idea that you 're getting out of work and einsatz with your emotional , , in the fight of such a , , abgestraftwerden ,
now , a great friend of me , i went to holland , because he was n't going to have to do that , because he wanted to have a allgemeinärztliche praxis , he had a aufgegeben , and he went to holland to become a doctor .
the holländer solchen are now in the world , and it 's the stückchen , and it was like the fact that the old experience was that , that there was more old menschen of the pflegeheim , the , , and go back , and the die did
and then in the hospital , the krankenhaus will go back to the seniorenheim , or pflegeheim , and then dort down .
and that hausarzt had just thought he thought that there was a little bit of in in holland , so i would like to go to work , and i would like to get there , and you know , there 's going to be something that 's going
now , in holland , he had to find out how he felt that a lot of fun had learned that it was exactly what this happened in the wie-wir-arbeiten-werden .
it 's also going to get a qualitätssicherung sterben .
it 's not the glaubwürdigkeit that 's going to be , but it 's even in a way that 's even in my mind , i do n't get to be wiederbelebt , or not in the hospital when i 'm in the pflegeheim .
and then this is the eingehalten .
in holland , it 's like this at the third days of a ted talk , and the müssen is festlegen , and i have to festlegen you , i want to go to the hospital , or i do n't want to go to the hospital if i
and that 's when i want to be wiederbelebt , or i do n't want to be wiederbelebt .
and then this is a zentrale of a zentrale and there 's a arzt at the end of the immer , and the arzt für für , and the decision on the floor .
now , if we look at rosalinde zurückdenken , which was very getanzt in your lifetime , and once a moment , and we imagine that a irgendwann would have a patientenverfügung , i would n't want to be able to be able to do this , i 'd
and that 's my friend , who is sitting in holland , very much kopfzerbrechen as much as he does .
in the last time , it 's like heut heut today , etwa percent of the population of people die at home , at the time , in hospitals , pflegeeinrichtungen , and that those pflegeeinrichtungen eben , as a result , is really eng , and
there are good heime that are very well very important to do , and there are people who are using enthusiastische , which is using it , but when i look at the gesamtbilanz , and we have about zwölftausend patients in the world , so , in fünf-
and this has got very , very interesting reasons , and it 's clear that this is all of a sudden , this whole qualitätssicherung , to control of the dafür , because the last of it is not enough , that all of the people who are willing
now , it 's just not just the reality , but it takes two zwei in the im and altenpflegebereich , and it 's still going to get it down .
this is the einführung of an qualitätssicherung growing folge , which is the ability to marktes the marktes , which means to be regulieren in the individuals .
and now i 'm going to come to you , as well , maybe we can entkommen away , so what we 're going to do now is that we 've been talking about this , because i 've got to ask you , and here 's the very
and that 's just what i 've been looking at as the hervorgekramt hervorgekramt and the article , and i 've been here , and so , as a sense , i think it 's always going to have to have a kind of structure that we have to
and in eben , it 's been a little bit of the people that people have been unantastbar .
and the second sentence there is to protect them is oberste 's aufgabe to all .
and what i 'm sometimes is a third sentence that sentence is that every single one should have the ability to protect its dignity and to verteidigen .
because this is a way of thinking of befreien from the case , i give the other way , and i think i 'm going to make it in a sense of time , and i 'm not going to have
because in the last time , it 's like , but if we do n't like to do this , we do n't like that , we will come to the point .
hopefully at the age of age , a hundred or hundertzehn .
so , of course , this is my job , to tell you that , i want to every day , and i want to think about it , but if you 're going to have to talk about it , and if you might be far , or
now , if you think about it , what makes my mind is , you 're going to come up to where you would go to the last day , what would be the five most things that were in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is ziemlich ziemlich .
it is , of course of the , , of course , that i have the friends who i 've been talking to and i can talk to me and share the things that i know and are going to live , you know , they 're the familienangehörigen
it 's safe to trust people , perhaps i have to be in the pflegebereich or the ärztlichen or a pfarrer or a rechtsanwalt or a other person or the other person i have with the relationship .
and there are many of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a sudden which is that in the , , which is now not going to go .
but if you look at these three points , you have a lot of jobs , you have already got a whole amount of work out of how you might have to be able to protect your own .
and then another thing is going to do it , that we experience some of the der of the gutmenschen , i made this as it as text as it as the way it .
other people can be able to make those choices and this behavior , which is what they do n't do .
this is my inner überzeugung .
and this would be just from us itself .
so it 's not the question , which is , what 's other to me , who will tell me , who is to me , who is a versorgen , a pflegen , or for me , who is about me ?
it 's exactly andersherum , fragen to me , where i can auf in people , where i can be mich , and the way that i can make sure that i can go with this question and i can be able to ausrichten it and
and if you say , how we 're going to work , so that we can do this , which is that this kind of qualitätssicherung , which is the qualitätssicherung that we 're von from außen , where it 's an opportunity to say , i 'm going
because no one can tell me how i think of myself , and i want to look at it .
and i do n't have to go into allgemeine in the stimmungslagen , or meinungen , who say , you 've got to go a patientenverfügung patientenverfügung , and because you 're so old , you 're just going to be thinking about it , you 're going to
this question , i can only kann the last few times of the past .
this is a brain that is würde by a und that is being mir by the outside , who ca n't be , to the government , not a nicht , who ca n't protect the state , not a gesetz , and the ones that can also tell
and to get these things , it takes a spaces , and i think , and that 's why i 've been so excited by this , and this is bereitet , and so , as i think about this , in a moment , is trying to look
so we say , `` well , we 're going to be good , '' a little bit like this , perhaps , perhaps , maybe , for a moment , i would have a very high age , but that would be even more .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm going to do two things .
if you 're the first part to the first part , you think about it is a little bit more wach.. .
there 's a second .
let 's start with it .
this is blöd . it 's got to take it .
what do you mean ?
is it different unendlichkeiten ?
or is unendlich enough ?
yeah .
it 's not good if there 's one of these things , which is what it looks like .
so , in fact , but i 'm going to take it for the people who know .
we do n't .
we 're only just about ourselves with one .
and i left the way to do a zum .
ne , endliche , we know , we tend to get an unendliche .
and it goes to the mathefreaks of größenordnungen in größenordnungen .
if we 're in the road , we 're looking at objektmengen two , one of the other things that look like in a different example .
we know that , yes , now , we 're going to see it in the box , which is that small , it 's three , and it 's three people .
so we can see , if we do any of the amount of elements in the crowd that are there ?
so , how would we do it ?
that means that we would just take people , , , two , three , we 'll get the three , we take them , they 're three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three ,
that 's what you do , yes ?
very nice .
this works in endlichen , it 's been working on big numbers , even though it works .
but it does .
how can we count it ?
how can you actually see that as many people like stühle are there ?
and i would look like i was looking at people and i would n't know , and whatever else .
morton bast
it 's called the paaren .
you can know that this is clear , not yet , now we 're on the road , and you can all understand it .
it 's not very good .
so , you 're called , you call , and you call this , and it 's also a professionell , and it 's like it , right ?
you take one , you put it on a chair , the mouse .
the next pärchen , weg , weg , next to , alles , is all it , different people can get , like , `` chair , are there , and no big are big , okay ?
now , we 're going to turn it .
how can we compare two unendliche of each other ?
we would say , well , that 's how big or bigger or smaller than the other ones .
we could we do it ?
we would begin to go .
exactly that 's wrong , because at the point , if you start to wenn at a long amount of time , yes , i would just start to think of it , you know , it would be just say , you do n't just know , you
ne , unendlich , is clear , ne ?
so how do it ?
madame ?
no way !
and she had just started this .
paaren !
so , here 's the moment .
notice , it 's always bad at all , you know .
you know , you know , it does n't end up , yes .
the point is this : it 's very easy .
so , for example , if i take the zahlenstrahl , we have to look , we 're natural brauchen at the end , zero , one , two , three , three , three , four .
and we had to say , if we put a copy of that , and we take a little bit of this kopie , and we do n't know that if we 're going to get enough , that 's a lot of a lot of the zahlen .
the left left is on the right , okay , zero , two , four , eight , eight , ne , ne ?
okay ?
everybody 's right now is aufm aufm at the long long surface of the natural dots , but on a band , the ungeraden that 's on the edge of the geraden are die and geraden , right ?
let 's call a number of g of the bottom line , call the other amount of n of the natural world .
what do you think ?
is more powerful , is it bigger than n , or large ?
the big big ?
it 's very sehr , gewagt , which is a lack of fehlen .
who is one inspiration ?
smaller ?
who tells you ?
ah , who does n't really have a plan , yes ?
it ca n't be that , yes ?
you do n't know where the missing is bigger , what , no , that 's not going to be ne .
okay , you say smaller ?
would you like , not ?
this is the gängige , you know , it 's wrong .
and now , now , i 'm going to tell you why that is the same .
how does it work ?
exactly .
yes , we are .
that 's the point .
we 're laughing .
we take the zero from the bottom amount , so we take the amount of food , we get it .
the next one , after two , two is two , two to the one , which is one to the one , and i 'll give you a pärchen .
the four , the four , the six , the four , the three , the four , the four , is there .
you can also turn around it , and it 's got to get off , is it clear , ne ?
and everything is clear , by the way that we 're creating this , i 'm going to go through it , and i 'm going to go through it in the vorlesung .
and there 's one thing , right , and the bottom is for the drauf and the band is good , but it 's in the long .
we verhexen the natural ones on the bottom , hex , the ungeraden , and the band is still very long .
that 's just happening .
so if you want to explain something about what we 've learned today , you 've got to start thinking about ja , yes , what do you know about , right ?
a lot of a lot of a sudden that there is n't a sense of the im , and that is the eigenschaft , and it 's an eigenschaft , is the charakteristikum , which is exactly big .
you do n't do this in the endlichen , if you look at three people three people , you 're still just one or a half .
yes , we did it .
is n't a eingeschlafen ?
okay .
then we do another one thing , one chance .
you know , the probability of the profis are bedingte .
i 've got some of this .
at this experiment , i 'm sure , is it going to be a third example , and it 's not going to be out of it , and it 's a macht of someone who has a drauf for it , right ?
so , let 's call the walls a , b , c .
i have n't come out of it , i 'm not sure you 've heard .
and you should just guess what 's first .
where , you know , i 'm going to get anything out there , behind a good b , b , c ?
well , here , here , our unser , here .
it 's based on c .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has one idea ?
brav , ne , b , gefehlt , nicht , no , is n't listening to the ne ?
that 's right .
it 's actually not all , you do n't have to be , but you do n't have to know what the first you 're going to have to get to get , and i 'm going to look .
it does n't matter , yes ?
it 's completely clear because it 's the only chance you have to be eh happiness , it 's only one third .
ne , there 's three things . it does n't matter , yes ?
now , i 'm going to do that , i 'm going to have a look .
good , i know what it 's like .
wehe , here 's someone who 's got here .
so , i know what it is , where it is , and what happens , and it or , what it is , and it turns out , `` second minutes . ''
so i 'm really wirklich , and now i 'm going to erklär spielregeln now .
so it 's like we go to a second round .
now , once i said , `` well , i 'm going to go on to a , , ne ?
so , i 'm going to show you a door behind it , not just , and you 're not going to have .
because when you 're b b , and i say , and i do know that it 's not b .
then there was no second side of them .
then i say , `` , , from the mouse . ''
but i have to say , this is the zweite , go to the second round .
so i can just have a aufmachen , not just not , but whatever you did n't .
now , the question , and this is the bedingte unter , even by the way here , the west , is that , because it 's a b , and it 's not been done , and it 's been the last chance that i 've ever wanted
they 're going to stay too much , then i 'm going to make a difference .
now i 'm going to do it with what you want .
or you say , i 'm c c .
now the mathefrage is ist , is it going to be more likely to get more likely to do this knowledge ?
puh , very beautiful , b is up , now i know it 's out of c .
or , god is so good that 's open up , it 's always going to be a lawyer , that 's a thing .
now , you would say , `` well , '' wir , we have ne , we have damit , and we do n't even two , now now , it 's not possible or not to stay .
what do you mean ?
it does n't matter .
fifty-fifty .
why is it possible ?
very nice .
why is it that it 's es ?
yes , exactly , that 's wrong .
now , almost as it was possible , when we were es yesterday , ne ?
but these are ne , they 're a little bit fun .
so , the idea is , this is a easy .
this is all the way that i do n't know , six and gentlemen , yes , i do n't want to jahren sechzig , maybe i 'm not going to be able to buy it anymore , or ? ?
so it 's really everybody .
behind the door , it 's too third .
and it 's always just a third behind a door .
you can guess what you want , you have the two liegen .
which means you could guess what to two , not , you know , that you 're going to go to roulette , but you 're going to have to have been on the two , you know , if you 're going to have two dozen words ,
but here 's only one door .
so now , this is a third third , it 's not what it is .
so , there 's a look up here , but it can only be on a door .
it does n't matter .
so , what is more about then ?
no way , i did .
so , what 's more about now ?
it 's better to stay on and do n't change ?
now it 's easy , yes ?
yes , of course .
so , that 's not hard , ne ?
ha !
what do we see ?
they were tired .
why ?
and it 's just one third , three , five percent , the difference between string and the praxis .
i hope , it 's for everybody .
thank you .
mr. reichert , you know , sie me to nach , which is just von , ernährung and essen people and people have told us that a sad completely did .
but i do n't mean , my best , that , all the time back , it 's coming back .
i came up with demeter 's farm , and i knew 12 , i was no english .
that 's kind of the end , right .
yes .
thank you for coming for me .
i 'm going to stay here .
and i do n't know if mr. reichert came up with him to ask me , whether i want to go to the ted on the sea , i wanted to talk about a particular topic .
i was heut heut : the issue of trust .
sure , there 's also no bad but it 's not bad , and i 'm going to go to the woman 's die , who said , maybe the power of one or another of the time .
i 'm also with the reason for that .
so today , when all the time you 've got a joggen noch , you 've got to ask a lot , but i have to have to eat tomorrow , because i 'm in the three of four weeks on an , and i 'm going to go
do n't get out of the morning that night does not invent the training .
so , you know , , mitfahren , rennradfahren tomorrow , go back to the morning , im in the morning , i 'm going to do all you .
i 've been right now , in short , a , , ich , i 'm talking about über on the subject .
and i started to get some of the thema , mit .
no worry about the beautiful , little abgedroschene , blind trust comes out .
i was doing a lot of myself , when i was a hergefahren , as i am a drüber , how do i describe what i 'm going to do with the best ?
so , i come from 'm village , with six , many äpfelbäumen , some hopfenstöcken and some of my students , there 's an apfel , and apfelsaft and hopfen -- and what you do is
trust , in sports , of course , not in doping , and i 'm like , `` oh , and bier .
why do you tell me the story where i am ?
for me , one of the very important stories , i think , really , really , from the country , from the village , and there , i 'm going to be here with two big brothers , with the french brother , the sehend .
and the second brother , who is the same one , as i do .
which is , you see , it 's blue , it 's blue , and it can also look like i 've seen , where is'n windows in the room , whether it 's light out of it .
what 's very good at the time is today .
the one , or we can both can see if we can see something .
'n pfosten , but i 'm not going to tell you , i ca n't be unterscheiden , is ist .
the one of the old der of my men , ne .
again , up to hierhin .
and what was really about me that was , of course , is the fact that you have trust , you just see that this is trust that trust , that kriegt , that we all know , in'ne as a spezielleren situation , i think .
and it was because my parents is that they were like me from my brother , and i did n't know any blind .
we were like the first time that i suddenly get to be geschneit in my life .
and then they had to do something out of the situation .
and , i 'm now , now , it 's a fantastic dangerous that my parents have been n't enough for us all day , and they 're just going to go back to the hand or say , `` there is a wall wall , you 're going
one would have been unangenehm , we have home .
and b , our parents , at the end of us , are inspired by us to go and to the way that our brother is beautiful .
so , in the haus alone , with alleine , treppen treppen and runterzurennen , they were able to risk .
there was my blind brother in mich with hof geschoben 's hof anhänger .
the narbe narbe narbe , i 'm still noch .
this is how they give up the big brüdern -- they 're not just good for the ellbogen , but for the schönheitsfehler .
and our daughter and and my colleagues and i went out to 'm , and i was going to alles out to the draußen , which i could do as a decision , to make peace , to the fahrrad .
and this is the sehende brother with begeisterung with three years , and then we thought of course , michael , i was .
and then , with mit , if you start with stützrädern , like 20 , children are going to go through , you know , geht das das .
so the kiddies can get .
but we 've got that even with stützrädern , eventually .
and then the big question : how wie would say ?
and as you get the trust of that , the person of the parents who will be , that the children will be wieder back from the back of the nicht'runterfallen , and nicht'runterfallen , and the one of the people that we do n't remember where we go
and the solution was , of course , we would say , one of our parents said , where are the risikostellen , so where the one is , where steht is anhänger , where you might have any sort of ungewohnten stuff , you 're -- you 're
and we had to fly to each other , and we had to look at the part of the face , but the other hand , or whatever .
and that 's not what you do today , and it 's not all of us now , because it 's like this , so it 's not like you 've got nothing more like this .
but heut , if you saw the light on the light , and you see it in your bedroom , or you 're also in your pocket , and you 're in the same way , and you know , as well , as well , you 're going
you can try to do , einfach with klickgeräusch to you , so that you can see that , in fact , people are just as well as bats -- they 're going to be a resistance .
so , as the bats that they 're mit , they 're going to hear them , now they have wand wand , widerstand widerstand because of sound sound .
and that is for me in trust , so trust that has been able to change the way , and it 's very important .
but auch'ne 's möglichst to be hohe , and it 's : i 've got a chance to help me with a piece of play .
and i was able to ohne with any kind of knowledge , and i 'm not sure , without any of the time that we have , or some of them , of course .
now , i do n't know what i 'm going to do today is that i 'm very bedaure in some of the lieblingssportarten i 've been in the von .
this is where the klettern klettern on our höheren building on 'm .
i 've been saying that : the selbstvertrauen is growing through an stückweit diversity .
and i mean , i 'm very close to this , because as a human being , i think that in a lot of the time , and in the coachingausbildung coachingausbildung , with trust , with no page , it 's a sache nie , and i never
i never read it as a way to read .
but it 's also not to have to know that , of course , it ca n't experience any of all of the experimentell .
diversity is the rausfinden of our unserer with the allerwichtigste , to find out , for where i am good , where i am , and i ca n't , and can i really understand my voll and voll eben ?
and our brother , again , my family has been und and me , and close to the left .
so he said , okay , we 're going to have a dachfirst here .
you can go out of the window from 'm window from the hopfentrocknungsanlage .
and the johannes went and then dann , and ' , and then i 'd just so'n the little bit of the girl , ne ne , i do n't know .
but , on the left , who still would be left ?
so i 'm not .
and i 'm going to be the ones that are the generation of the young women , women here , not yet .
and that 's why i am still still .
and then the consequence of that was that we were going to have all three drei aufm in the top , and the papa mit with mit anhänger mit with 'm traktor , and no longer knew what he 's going to say to do .
because trust is , of course , when the guy is .
so the father would have said , for god 's , help , help , help , that would be pretty bad to that , that the one of us had to angst and und and im , , , -gekullert -- i do n't
it 's never done .
he also had to so , so he 's just dass that he was a langsam , but he 's got vorausgeschickt der , and it was a little bit of vorausgeschickt .
and that was what i was very good for me that we had this opportunities .
but clearly , no worry about this is not an voraussetzung , not necessarily to get out of it .
for me , the different sportarten that i was interested in , which was always important to me , because it 's interesting .
and all they were all was to do that , because i could see , i know , i could see , where i am like i have , i 'm going to have the borders that are probably my begabungen .
so , ner guten can never have been able to be able to be able to do that .
i never had never hatte it .
and i 'm not going to leave you too much today .
i 'm going to go out of rain .
it 's not five and a lot of the moment .
and strömendem regen -- but still , i 'm going to be a drinnen .
but i always have been , in fact , to make sure that i believe in my strength , i found different kinds of sportarten .
for example , first of all , judo .
and that was a good thing for me , because there was the trainer that had us in front of us , said , `` okay , we have a kinder kids , and we 're going to give children with children .
in fact , it 's because it 's going to take you anywhere at the bottom .
and then you realize the other person .
and it was always my big trust , of course , when i 'm going to get the wettkampf for a long time , it 's difficult , because the other may have been something i do n't know .
so , there 's just a way of that , and this is trust , which is my schnelligkeit .
the other way to take a foot in the leiste can make me look like me , den your head 's head , and he 's back , and it 's back , and the wettkampf is over , because the full punktzahl is there .
i 'm not going to show you this .
but i was thinking about it .
i do n't know , that 's bisschen bisschen now .
and i should n't have any farmer here , or have n't here , do it ?
ne .
sorry , i 've been ' .
okay .
the next thing i was interested in is as an sport in the school , then the eben und in the . , and biathlon it .
my parents were home home , and they were alpinenskifahrer to heute , and they were trying to teach us as children .
but for me , i was very clear to school , how can i move a lot of the time to make my überschüssige energy ?
and that 's when i was having an opportunity to go to school .
and even though i was thinking about it , this is all of the boring boring , because weil is something that is very für about the omas .
and i used to be -- i do n't know anymore .
so i said , i said , `` well , i 'm going to go through beim .
and then , in fact , first of all , if you were first , first people , again , this is the big diversity in the office , because you need kondition , you need to kraft , you 've got to kraft , you know , kraft
klingeling -- so you have probably been able to get some of their work in the way ?
that 's actually what it 's like to do .
you 're just going to quickly quickly if you just have the whole trust in your own evolution .
if you have the trust in your own -- it 's the force that you 're actually going to be able to communicate , in the same way , the traditional snow , the weichen of the country will be able to bring the ski .
and if you have a choice in my case , you have the trust in the team .
because as a , , which is nothing that i 'm angewiesen , of course , of course , it 's angewiesen .
and i never never have been krasses out like today -- i have to use the word -- my vorrednerin -- there was only one -- there was only one thing as well as i was doing it .
so nothing is nothing we do .
now , i 'm going to be erspar to you .
go to one , one , one of them still get a baby .
and what i 'm always doing to do is that i 'm going to make sure , i think , at the point that i 'm talking about the audience is that , and i 'm trying to be able to tell the audience that we can think of
so when langlaufen langlaufen langlaufen , you know , you have two stöcke in your hand .
therefore , sure , yeah , i do n't give any more hand , maybe i could take my head and blindenstock myself to the selber .
it 's not .
so , i have to help .
i then hab my meinen to the point that i was just vor .
and that tells me to the voice .
so that 's the only thing you can have to do .
and that 's important to trust .
so the in in communication , so in the ansagen .
and the begleitläufer tells me only hopp when the geht is , the sagt says to me , and rechtskurven says , `` left to 11 , '' i know that it is on the left , because i 'm going to go out on the left , on
if he says , `` on 10 , schärfer schärfer on the left , '' when he says , `` on average .
okay , everybody understood ?
then natürlich'n natürlich'n problem , because i need to be nochmal again , or i must have to do it again , i do n't know anything , but i do n't know .
and for me , that 's great , really , because when the begleitläufer vor of the front before me , i just got to see that very , very quickly to tell me this really completely ausliefern .
to tell you , he says , `` i 'm going to give you the tools that allows me to be quickly , and it 's a very fast speed , and in the same direction that you 're looking at the same time .
and that 's the only thing i can do when i 'm only going to be able to abzudrücken with you , with two arms i 've got to stand up with a leg , and i 'm going to go to the eyes , i 'm going to
and then , it 's like fahrn , and it 's going to be on the other leg , and it 's genauso , and it 's kind of little hier , and it 's actually going to be easy .
also , with five sides .
yes , and that is a really important thing for me , if i 'm in langlaufen , like i 'm going to talk to you , the one i said , `` oh , i just saw men begleitläufer begleitläufer , and i 'm going to say to
so , who do n't mean what he 's going to tell me .
so , i 'm the one who has been able to move the way around .
and that 's what happens to be .
if anyone did n't know my own , he ca n't help me , but i am , but i 'm just asked to say , i need to make sure that the curve might be schon'n bissl .
or , i need to do something like this , which is that in a moment , that you just thought it 's a little bit like a long time , because if we hochfahren the pfänder , you 're thinking about it .
and if you look like it 's like bekloppt , it 's not just going to hear .
and i 've got some of the time , and i 've also got the pilot to call it , as we call it in auf , at the moment , in 'm tandem , who told me that we 're only going to be going to be about
so , for me , it 's important to me , it also has to be genauen , ansagen .
i 'm in the gemurmel .
one of the other things ?
so my best time was , i was , even faster , but that was in april , and now , in april , i 'd never told you that i would never be so much faster than sechsunddreißig .
and at the wetterbedingungen , at the moment , fiese'gschicht fiese'gschicht .
and for me , as i said , these ansagen are actually even if i 'm wearing my loved my own .
but the other thing about me is to explain what he sees to me , and the possibility i have , i have to get my risks .
and this is one of the most important things i tell you : `` trust is more , and training and training .
now , of course , you do n't know that much of it is n't right now .
because i also had the experience that i had angesagt a begleitläufer on the right side to the right side .
and then it was bad at the time , because it was at the top three feet .
and i 'm the meter of three feet only .
so , of course , as i said , it was -- of course , that was damals .
now , i know that the begleitläufer must be begleitläufer , they have to be spiegelverkehrt .
and i 'm going to see that there are people that say , `` i say , `` on , '' -- `` on , '' the other thing .
so then , on the left , unfortunately .
they do n't have a lot of a lot of the alltag .
but clearly , in so'ner situation with druck , that you probably probably have all your work out of work , and as soon as soon as soon .
then , of course , the other thing is , of course , is very oft of hard challenge .
but for me , as i said , is blindes blindes blindes , i think that i have to know the risks .
and i have to say , `` i 'm as a guy who is not , relatively big , but i do n't know my own in many ways .
now , as you can see , beim , i 'm like that all .
from the fahren gegen'n tree , from fallen to runter , which i know , and of course -- and of course , and that 's the important -- i do n't know the good side .
and then , as soon as they can get , if you trust people .
and when you find someone who 's also been a hundred percent of them , as i have to use .
and i was also thinking about the same thing as well .
because this is the moment i believe in the moment in terms of the next , very important .
you need the same goal , and you have to really be clear , actually , what does it mean mean , that 's not really useful , right ?
because it 's often more complicated than much to do it .
i have the ones or the self .
but the most important thing is , it 's already very much .
that you do , you know , you trust a lot of trust .
you know , yes , because we 're all menschen . because we 're going to have to do anything with irgend'nem irgend'ner -- we want to see ja'n sense of it .
and the sense that 's very often is that we also create to be able to target ziel .
we can do it . in my case , for example , from example , i 've been in the ' .
and i 'm right now . i have to make you guys here , i 'm going to be able to make someone else that i 'm going to do so that i 'm actually able to put this hole up .
and how do you do that on the mountain you have on the mountain at the mountain ?
all right , i knew the riesen advantage , i did n't even know if i did n't know , if i do n't know , if i do n't know , if i do n't know , it 's going to take a hundred meter .
then i was pretty das .
it can be a vorteil advantage , but that 's not a problem .
and i 've been working on the way back to the höhenangst , and i 've been unabhängig from unabhängig klimandscharo , and i 've got to do that , and i made this thing , and i put it in the baseflying , and it was mit in
it 's been bisschen bisschen , if you go to the top , you 'll hear the car , and you do n't have to see a lot of it , you can not have to get a lot of knowledge to get it out .
and so things are always always fun for me .
and so , in order to have the adrenalinkick , but the only way to know , i say , `` well , i 'm going to be a good thing , i 'm going to go to the point that i 've just been able to konzentrieren ,
and the genau genau little bit of little beim , because in so'nem berg , you know , it 's about 10 miles away , and it 's just a little bit of </S> .
you 're going to go and you 're still going up and around , around , just less plants .
you take the anfang'n ranger , , gewehr gewehr von from the world war ii .
so if you see mal'n büffel , then the ranger is about the last one , the der .
and then , that 's the thing that 's happening .
we 've seen the büffel büffel out of the distance or the other .
from that hatt , i was doing anything of trust trust in the ranger -- despite his intellectual wurme that he had .
because i thought , `` well , '' i said , `` well , '' i said , `` i 'm going to go out of the way that i 'm probably going to go back and faster than the thing is going on .
but as i said , it 's otherwise ansonsten , because you 're not really interested in terms of it .
and what 's wrong about it is , if something is hard .
so if you go to the level of hochkommt and then the air .
or if it 's next to a runtergeht , if you have so'n so'n 's wo , where you 're left and left to you .
and then it 's a beautiful thing , and if it 's still night , and every time it 's night , and all of the mit of it , and it 's also said , and it was also said that sometimes the bergführer , and sometimes in
because i 'm as a ohne without da , and that 's why it was funny .
trust that we 've created , i just said , `` well , i ca n't know , i know , of course , of my , , my friend , who 's been a hundred percent trust , '' i said , `` you 've got all right
but i need to be a ne form of security , but i do n't need to focus on the way that i 'm not going to be able to focus on because you can think that if you 're going to go to the bottom of the right
it 's going to be kirre , and it 's all that .
so for us , we trust trust , we 've got uns'ne verbindung , so we ham a seil on their rucksack , which i was in a hand , and i put it in the back , and i
in fact , in the other hand'n dass , i wanderstock that i had so'n the höhe of stufen .
and she 's actually going to fuß with auf'n 's stein getreten , or has hat with stein wanderstock dass , which i just knew before i 've ever been thinking about what i 've been doing on this process , and i did n't really want to focus
and what i 've seen is that this is exactly how beautiful it is , because of course , you know , at the end of it , there 's a nähert that you have , just , in fact , that you have the same thing as a
but the other thing is , i think , is that i 'm sure that i 'm in love , that i 'm just going to go out there , that i 'm actually going to show you , like the jetzt .
but it 's true to other people in the way that the wie that they 're doing .
so , when we were in the middle of the night , we were all in the gruppe , and we were very vorne at the group of the people , and we have seven , and we have the number of teilnehmer students , and they 've been
at the moment , you ca n't look at the bottom of the americans .
that 's not the reason why it 's so .
and then , i was gemerkt , eventually , at the moment , yes , klar , that trust is very ziemlich .
you 're walking at night and night , and you 're at 12 o'clock in the morning , and then you do n't have a light .
this is completely anstrengend , if you 're übermüdet , the air is dünn , and it 's only noch , and it 's not just going to be more vergügenssteuerpflichtig .
and then , at some point , at the moment , where the question said , `` people , who was really , really , hinter , just behind you , because the friend of me told me all of me , we just wanted to know , but
so , all of the night all came out to us , and the other in the group had just shown in the same as well as well as well , and it 's just an hour hour , and it 's just about stunde .
or i did n't know what was going on in the mountain .
and in fact , this is someone who is n't there , maybe it 's never very bad at this point , but perhaps we 've been talking about it -- it 's just about stunde , the sun is going to go up .
and these are things that , in fact , the way that the spiegeln can be able to vertrauen , and it can make a difference that you will also learn the persönliche of goldmedaille .
and for me , trust is always there , and it 's a great thing , when it 's the same goldmedaille , if you think about it as a personal persönliche , and that 's what you really want to do , then the idea is right here
this is , of course , in the robot with the gold , which is so reinbeißt , i do n't know , i do n't know , that 's what i 'm doing , and i do n't know , to know what the sportler is going to
so i 'm going to have a medaillen to some of the time that i 've been doing , and i have been the gramm gramm .
if that was real gold , then i did n't show up here , i would go to the bahamas , i was glaub .
or at least in lichtenstein , irgendso'n steuerparadies .
but as i said , i 'm going to do it , and why you make that , is that , you know , what i 've done is a lot of a lot like this , i 've got the ability to do , and i 've got
as i said , i was in love with my fähigkeiten , but of course , in the team , we all know , no matter , in the job , the things that always did .
anyway , old age or young woman , we need to see people , but we can trust .
and if we have a klar in the head of eyes , and we have already changed it , then the evidence is that we have to trust in one project in our lifetime .
and if you can even do it , you can even find it in some galaxy .
thank you very much .
now science science to me , this is the title of my talk , which has been nach for her beautiful maps .
what i 'm doing is , it 's the very ganz bemühung of naturwissenschaften , which is naturwissenschaften science , and also selbstverständliches into the population of bevölkerung .
basically , i could be happy .
when i 'm in a buchhandlung gucke , it 's all regalmeter of the same kind of media to talk about the themen of die .
even each other hat has a range of populärwissenschaftlich newspapers , zeitschriften , magazinen , where scientific solutions , hochkomplexe problems , irgendwie things like irgendwie .
every fernsehsender is at least one fernsehformat , where some of the scientific issues will be verarbeitet .
even , that 's completely abstrus , if you look at it , what it 's about in und and for children with children with science .
every student has been looking at a eigenen ableger in the kioskregal , but yet , it 's an intellectual konsumierende story .
science is a thing that i can love to show you , which i can love to read , but that does n't tell me me .
cool , cool is a little bit of bei with csi , bad bad , somewhere , is the chemiker of , , ne ?
in csi , there 's a fünf five minutes , there is nothing nothing about the reality , but that is cool , ne ?
there i am .
big bang theory , i can laugh on it , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
this is extremely great .
because , this is a little bit of humor , and the future is going to be able to deal with us , with this kind of collective fragestellungen and things .
but at the same time , none of them is no time .
i 've got a couple of little examples of how long , or science is just right now in the same way .
a ganz example of london , in fact , you have a beautiful , , hochhaus , the architect , but it 's not like this , it 's kind of like this .
what happens is that now , the sun is sonneneinstrahlung in these fassade , i have the mal angedeutet angedeutet , and you can go back and find out somewhere in the other stadtteil .
that was big off the press , because it was actually just a gerade .
pr , it 's so kanalisiert that this poor jaguarbesitzer , that , for a long time , is a long time , has been the sind geschmolzen .
so , you know , a architect , that , at the point , is not so much of this a little bit like this , because i mean , it 's completely new , that it 's kind of a lot of the game .
so , what i found out is a new , ist , ist zweihundert , where he angeblich angeblich with strahlen strahlen .
so , what i 'm going to do is , what is the more design or architect , or where did we know ?
now this is an example of example .
a klassiker , as stellenwert , solch this kind of aktuelle , is the gentechnik .
gentechnik , it 's now a few years ago , that 's kind of a lot of the media .
there was a train in the weil , because the gentechnologisch was pflanzen , which is at the risk of danger .
genes was gleichzusetzen with grüner gentechnik .
genes were kind of a böses .
ne , oh , there are genes .
there was a place where the really focused on the market was actually , hey , i have genfreies vegetables .
there is no idea what that should be , yes .
so , yeah , okay , holländische tomaten , we can get more of it .
but at the time , i was in the lab , and i was still aktiv , and eventually i became very surprised by these bad genes in my bacteria , these verfluchten mistdinger .
and it was completely surprised , came to home , and my damalige nachbarin , och , you do n't know , is n't it ?
so i said , yes , i 've been building a little gene in three of these days in my bacteria , and it does n't work at all .
that was what i tried to explain to them , to kind of a irgendwie experience , a few genes , genes , i thought , yes , the good lady , when i 'm talking from genes , you know what they 're doing .
that was what i actually meant to find , so that there 's an example that i was trying to bring in these verfluchten .
but that was what the woman did .
i did n't give that woman again .
who knows what i 'm doing , ne ?
genes is something that 's böses .
this is now for 10 years ago , and yet , it 's kind of im of consciousness .
genes , this is something böses .
genfrei , i did n't read anything .
it 's always going to have a technology technology , and it has really in in its language .
super-genmais could be alive to europe , a message .
genmais is much more interesting in other corn , which is not a gene genes .
a human , , rats have been lässt to die .
yeah , that was a beautiful statement .
that 's not old , and it 's not enough to worry about it , i think , i think , i think .
no matter , the time or the picture , all the sprechen .
fortunately , it 's not a inner inner , but i 'm afraid , it 's not going to go anymore .
but this is just what you see in terms of what is called the population is that you do n't just deal with the issues .
we have to gleichwohl in our future with our technology .
now it was just gerade , and none of the big bang on the things , and it 's going to be about abgestimmt and über , which most of them have had no idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
so , how do this actually happen to this from the world in the world ?
when we think about this little boy , young scientists , the scientists , who scientists in an experiment , in a experiment , has an experiment , and it 's good , and it 's worth that , that 's what 's going on
then we have to go back to the professor .
the chef , the entscheidet , the subject , right about it , is his name on top of it , erstautor is always always important in science .
good idea , i still have n't been in the public , it 's on a pressesprecher .
yes , the pressesprecher thinks , oh , great , i think , great , there 's a pressemitteilung draus .
mhm , there 's a pressemitteilung with a project , a beautiful idea , and that 's kind of a raus out of it .
that 's what 's going to stop , yes , right ?
now , as a result , only alone , it 's almost a couple of forschungsinstitute , a lot of forschungsinstitute , a lot of träger .
and from that , you will look at the outputs , the really cool projects , then you 'll be talking about the pressesprecher to the museum , the chefredakteure , whether it 's leibniz , fraunhofer , helmholtz or helmholtz .
that 's the path .
and the way is , it 's getting more gefiltert , and it 's up to the elfenbeinturm , and it 's really really to start experiments , experiments , really , new art projects that are really in the projekte show .
that 's a big hochwertige magazine , which is really good , is it from all of us , but yes , who do i have with it ?
basically , basically , that just kind of think about this .
in wissenschaftskommunikation , in the nennen we call it the bekehrung of the katholiken .
so the ones that are interested in this is that the abonnieren noch , the one , the beautiful , beautiful , and ...
beautiful magazine , finally the zielgruppe who are interessieren , who are probably there , and that probably might have an idea where wodrüber 's going to put in it .
who erreich me really have to do that ?
the katholiken who are working on it .
so , that was the case that was the , normalbürger , i call him dr. herrn herrn müller-schulze who was unter under other other publikationen , and i tried to think it was , i did n't really get the erreiche
but again , again , our future , we 're going to be able to do if we can deal with this .
fracking , gentechnologie , local energy , energien , these are all kinds of die that are herrn , not the idea of herrn , and not to understand them .
this project , my idea is so different , , , , young scientists , aus scientists out of the elfenbeinturm , really entirely from part of the body , and he 's sitting there ,
and what happens is that a lot of a sudden , a scientist that i have is a kennen , we 've already been kumpel for us , but it 's elektro-ingenieur , it 's a regel rule , it does n't mean for us to ask
as soon as he mund the mouth and he 's talking about his , , he hat us .
ne , these are scientists that tell you about von .
hu , hört chemisch , ne , chemisch is almost as much as the niveau as genes .
it means that , in fact , that 's kind of , oh , you do n't know what 's wrong here .
and it 's really trying to look at it , and it 's beautiful and good when you 're on a conference and you ask you to tell you people who are willing to tell you , augenniveau , but you 've got to tell you , but
where is the problem , really , it 's herunterzubrechen and normal ?
so , i 'm high school , this young scientists , who are still not so far that we 're so far , are still so far -- that i have a little bit of formbar , which i am going to go out
this is for a given , drittmittelgeber , einen , whatever , as investors , who want to know what 's going on in the forschungsinstituten .
and then , the thing is , the steuergelder are , in fact , that they 're going to be using this , and they do also müssen the steuerzahlern .
but this is the surgery that 's been a story .
so i want to really quickly you to look at a jury , and you want to imagine the project , you know , you 've got to project , you know , an ihr , an , , erbarmungslos , ehrlich , sad , is n't it ,
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that 's real , but einstein : it ca n't just tell you , you know , you do n't really understand .
so , the scientists come from the lab , and the project really is to think , how can i really make this verständlich ?
it 's got a lot of stories .
kinderunis are completely modern , everywhere , in every school , in school , but also , but in the principle , that i just basically wieder the katholiken .
who is to leave the fährt on the city of the city of the city at the sonntagmorgen of the holt , where a vortrag zu comes from vortrag tageszeiten ?
that 's the thing that i think most of the time is .
there i was again my meinen .
so that 's the people who think of care about this , and they 'll hear each other .
this is beautiful , because some of them are knall-puff-peng-experimente , all of them are happy , they 're happy , they 're home .
and so i 'm going to put a second second , say , it does n't stop the einmal-vorstellen of the project .
these scientists are still even more , like , in eigentlich , are in children 's work ?
because a lot of really focused on , to wesentliche the level .
because scientists , like the research , and how the world study their way , is the way that the world 's future is the same .
kids work very well wissenschaftlich .
they 're doing something like that .
you try to make it , right ?
patsch , patsch , no , no , does n't work , next door , ich , i 'm going to make a couple of it , and it 's going to go back .
children learn extremely wissenschaftlich .
this is really forschungsprozesse , try and error , and gucke , ich , whatever , which i think , i have to change that there 's not going to be done .
that 's normal .
but that 's what many people have .
and from that , i think , is that , if all the die is going to come out , and this scientist , in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood , with the children , from the school , from the , , from the , , from
and then you might think , maybe a minute , this is my hope , the kids will tell you , and then , then , i auch , mr. meier-müller-schulze , who is to think of the science that 's going to
this is not even somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere somewhere , and his children tell kids tell him , `` it 's a real spiegel of a living room , but it 's a brot gebacken , and it 's got a bread , and
and not only , i was herrn herrn , of course , but the zeitungsleser .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's still that there 's the first testkandidaten that i wrote , which said , `` no , no , no , for the scientists , that 's not the other thing .
a scientist must have to communicate .
yes , i think , okay , i 'm going to get okay , and i 'll play the next .
but , in fact , in a way , which is working in a center , elektro-ingenieur is in a company like you 've got to be able to start next next step .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , the question .
you ca n't fly fly every day .
the last weeks was schrecklich .
the weather has made us a big paper from the simple .
seven , seven , seven years ago , i 've been asked , i 'm going to ask you about this .
i was in the , , almost 10 years , in the dornier regionalflugzeuge in münchen and in . .
we 're here right now .
there was an als as a client .
and for me , this was kind of , really , really , really , this is liebhaberei .
what should i do ?
luftschiffe , that 's actually ridiculous .
but i 've already learned who who 's there , and that 's why i 'm here .
and maybe it 's a little crazy crazy , but it 's actually very effective .
it 's beautiful and it 's always exciting and it 's fun .
and i 'm just going to tell you you in the next few years , and i 'm going to tell you a little bit of this life of a life of life .
i 'm a geschäftsführer in the zeppelinluftschiffbau .
there 's a lot of years of a thousand years ago .
i 'm on the geschäftsführer of the . .
this is a company that has been around for years .
and geschäftsführer of the . .
the company has already been over neunzehn or achtzehn years .
the betreibt betreibt zeppelin on the edge .
zeppelin .
the one that i want to show you here is the little point , which is right , is actually a roter , so it 's a roter roter , or something that 's not a dot , a little bit of a weiß , or something that does
it 's only just a dreiundzwanzig luftschiffe .
and it 's actually not even more active .
that 's what it looks like .
there are about 20 thousand aktive worldwide worldwide .
so that 's actually not a hospital .
that 's not even a nische .
this is a unikum , a exot .
and the question is : why do you actually do that ?
how about that ?
dreiundzwanzig in bestand , and only because of each other , we can still tell you about this one .
very quickly .
neunzehnhundert has a von , a lot of vielen , has been luftfahrt in .
thank you very much .
and until neunzehnhundert neunzehnhundert , at the time of vor , ersten weltkrieg rund rund .
then in the first world , graf zeppelin died from starb , and , , rund gebaut was gebaut .
they then turned out of london and so on and so forth .
and when we went to und and eight to london , and with a big getränkekonzern there , a dreimonatige campaign , to a zeitungen campaign , were zeitungen with the überschrift men , who said , `` well , not just about sondern , but in advertising ,
so it 's kind of the way that the story was happening .
and we had a irre campaign .
but inbev , the client was not so popular , because he suddenly became clear that there was actually going on there , which was the old memories of these old things .
and that was a good thing to do .
but yet , in london , it was a great campaign , because the weather in the north was a lot of a thousand years ago , very few years ago .
and we 're not sehr .
then neunzehnhundert zwanzig , hugo hugo hugo hugo hugo .
and he 's got a reparationsluftschiff bewerkstelligt , which he went to america .
this is what 's going to do with you , the whole deutsche nation has ever been a bit of a als , and it 's been a bit more nämlich by the time .
it was in the new york city where the empfangen was in new .
and the whole great nation has died of aufgestanden , we are the ones .
that 's in the biografien allen , and that 's really a little bit of this little bit of this statement of this .
but in fact , neunzehnhundert are nur , and only six times five , six , seven , if you 've ever been doing the right thing , the two things that the graf are .
passagiere , passagiere , passagiere , passagiere and passagiere were es at the gesamt .
but it was a myth .
and the hindenburg-unfall then the first live of the first live of the crash was actually even leider .
and when the idea is , in the end , there is a ikone , where a ikone is untergegangen , then it 's still going on .
the other ones that have been eingestellt .
and neunzehnhundertneununddreißig , neunzehnhundertvierzig , had existierende the last few zeppeline existierende .
they 're using the materials for kriegsflugzeuge , -produktion , the abgebaut .
then , long ago , there was nothing about sechzig years .
and then they had the die zf and und und , who had the idea , maybe we should start to get it back .
and i was wurde eingestellt , because you 've got an amazing product , we 're going to be able to do that , but the market .
yes is it a market ?
so what is going on here ?
it 's like that .
that 's what we 're now talking about .
the graft zeppelin , this is probably just a long one , but we 're zeitlich zeitlich , and we have a lot of people .
there are many companies that companies that come out of this .
it 's achtzigztausend , , employees , over seven billion billion .
this is a right wirtschaftskraft , hoch .
there 's a lot of it .
now , i 've convinced to be here .
the zeppelin on the right is that it 's a normales like the other person 's like , but also , sorry , hat innendrin , it does n't grow hydrogen , and innendrin innendrin a gasmanagement with luftsäcken .
it 's like a wal that 's in the water and in the bottom , and there 's a druckausgleich .
now , it 's not there to explain that .
in the way , a zeppelin is like this , as a structure .
there are two types of luftschiffen .
there 's starre luftschiffe , which is us , reibstarr in the case and prallluftschiffe .
they do n't have the structure in the form , and they are like quasi in in .
that 's the most luftschiffe luftschiffe that has been built in the world , rund , fünfhundert stück .
and of course , it 's only today , as i said to , even more dreiundzwanzig in our bestand were actually minus our own rund , but only 20 to 20 .
that 's what the production is , when a hülle is aufgezogen .
on the ground , you can see the structure .
and the tumor is also hochtechnologie .
come out of the raumfahrttechnologie .
eb : the raumfahrtanzüge of the national office .
mondlandung back there , the ursprünge are .
costs one kostet two million dollars as a device .
it 's got to be gasdicht , it has to be uv-abstoßend , and has to be reißfest , but because it 's going to be a gucken , and it 's a little bit of time that once we have a little bit of a
there 's the mitarbeiterinnen nochmal again , and you see , if you see , it 's going to be used to löcher .
and at the end , there 's no ohne without the anbauten .
so the zeppelin is a technisch product .
and that 's what you see here , on the bottom line .
one thing nine percent , one percent nine percent , one more at least six vier , which is about six thousand flügen in the year , may be aus .
that 's very little and very good .
this is a industriemarkt .
you can see it .
but there 's another trend that 's sorgen to you , and that 's where i came up here .
we had three percent wetterabsagen years ago , as i started , five years ago , five years ago , und prozent percent , and last year , siebenundvierzig percent , oder percent .
and this year in the year , we were at sechzig .
if you have the eight years , my eight years , with zeppelin and und , and then you want to be saying , in this eight times , you know , one in the eight years , of course , as a result of the klimaforschung , also
we are windabhängig .
we ca n't fly through them with water .
you want something to see .
and the die , or the steigen , are going to happen is going to happen to each year .
so a little bit of a little bit wetter is that the only nature we did n't only experience , but it 's also because we do it all day every day .
but because that 's how it is , so , this is a good thing to do , the european programm is a program in klimaforschung , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're a wesentlicher part of this program .
now , i 'm just now finnland today .
the luftschiff is here in the middle , is a fliegendes lab .
pegasos is the campaign .
and we 're doing luftanalysen in the zwischen between the surface of the earth 's surface feet .
it 's called planetare grenzschicht .
and the zeppelin t goes back into italy and nach for finnland in gesamtprogramm .
over a lot of hundred hundred misst of misst and the sun , the air that the chemisch are , as they reagiert on our things we do at the ground .
so , i 'm just so sorry , because this is the second thing that we 're at the second time .
it 's a great honor .
and if you want to look at the konkret konkret of the weather .
so that 's the good thing .
and there 's a couple of impressionen here .
the luftschiff of the luftschiff over the last week or vorletzte week .
and in ireland , the weather is great , it 's ne , fünfundzwanzig degrees , and a thousand degrees .
the finnen say something that they had never had .
i 've just been looking at this , and it 's a few days , pretty well .
they 're also not enough .
we were also in africa .
and for example , as gesucht as we 've been diamanten sondermission as the diamanten diamanten , the gesagt are vulkane , the unterirdisch are durch by erosionen million million .
also , you can also be wondering , is that africa is africa , and then you 'll be a sinnvoller , if you ask a sense of meaning , a question of questions , is a good question to ask , and that is a good thing to
and then i was thinking , what do we do about it ?
and what do we learn by this ?
at the end , we 've been there for two years .
and then the auch did n't stop .
the whole gesamte came to the zweitausendacht , and the project was finally won .
and a surgeon who was den at the point of the time , so he 'd been able to figure out that he was going to go down .
but it was n't that bad .
we had had a lot of enough , and we were very happy .
that was the first one .
and i did n't know what to do with that .
it 's what we 're doing today , a very short lehrbild of light from the betriebswirtschaft .
what we 're doing today , it 's just about , it 's about complexity , it 's about social , or whether it 's , or ,
what we 're doing today 's today is luftschiffbetrieb in in .
we 're going to do so , of course .
we have to get it out there .
obsoleszenz is called . .
there are always there that are there in the way that 10 percent of the time , 10 years ago that you have to get .
we just took the entire avionik-system for almost five million dollars .
so with the clients that we talk about that we are still talking about .
we 're going to have to do the grundentwicklung .
we 're a luftfahrt , betrieb , who is kontrolliert from the british luftfahrtaufsicht , and the european aufsicht , and it 's always always and andauernd and andauernd , and überprüfungen , and also like überprüfungen .
it 's also aufwändig and kostet and money will still get erhalten .
the question is : do you actually go further ?
do we get further ?
do you get bigger luftschiffe ?
there 's cargo-luftschiffe , there 's gibt luftschiffe .
what do you do ?
are we going to go to the market ?
are you going to get around ?
and that 's why we 've also tried to do that in time .
and we 've also got some niederlagen erlitten .
and as the result , the graf zeppelin had some niederlagen erlitten , and they did a mehrfach .
at the beginning of the stand , there was a spende of spende spende .
the population of the people who have been , in fact , the deutsche people had this mit six months ago when he had a spende , when he was luftschiff at the time , when she was , she was basically a pleite , and he turned in
and it was even the zeppelinkonzern of luftschifffahrt and und and other companies , we would know , or maybe i could n't be able to be able to do anything else today or so many people today .
we were in tokyo , traumstadt .
we were , and they were past a year , in san francisco with a client .
and it made a very potenter investor .
both of the projects , unfortunately , unfortunately .
so niederlagen .
in the same time , we won goodyear .
and i did n't have a picture , because we do n't have the zeigen yet .
but in america , now , the des is the luftschiffes of the first luftschiffes in fertig .
we brought them to be three .
with goodyear , we develop a process of a partner with a collective .
and that 's a big success , but at the same time , it 's the only one .
two customers customers were killed in weil because it was n't gone .
why was n't it ?
we 've already seen it .
either the place was n't the right or the passagiere had to be too far , or in america , you know , the first 30 years of haben years .
the ham people have heraufgeschaut , they saw luftschiff , they have said , `` och , '' a ein , a macht , the macht .
there is n't some reason that the reason ca n't come to you .
and it was actually a little bit difficult in the marketing about the audience : hey , people call me and go .
bodensee läuft .
the national pressure was in the 19th century , begrüßen begrüßen , passagiere passagiere .
but last year , we 've just been elftausend elftausend .
it 's almost half a million times .
that 's pretty bad .
the zeppelin is sechzehn routen here .
it 's a sense of what 's beautiful , when i 'm also as a geschäftsführer , as it turns out , as the passagiere aussteigen and all of us and all of us , and we do n't really have a werbung , because it 's
and we are great gebucht .
i 'm still going to have aufräumen aufräumen , and i 've got to feel that we 're going to be ausgebucht .
you could still do more flüge .
we have a nimbus at the bodensee , and we 're ausgebucht .
it 's actually not exactly that .
we 're also advertising .
this is a project that was audi to das .
and audi has done this here with the island of mainau .
but the werbemarkt is a difficult market .
and you also have to ask yourself the sinnfrage : macht does not make sense ?
we actually have actually advertising about it , but the internet has a lot of changes in terms of the flugverbote , because the großsponsoren are going to change .
gewerbemarkt gewerbemarkt is largely weggebrochen , and there is only 10 or luftschiffe of the world in the world .
we have three right here .
two aktive , one verpackt , das , three , three gekauft , are gekauft , 10 .
so then , six , 10 .
so this is going to be actually going to actually , if we 're in the market , if it 's at least , it 's to control .
and hope that we can also get a future .
and the thing that 's scott is called apollo , apollo fünfzehn , and he 's nach , and he said , `` look , '' -- `` then , you 're going to go to the moon . ''
so zeppelinfliegen is beautiful .
we do need to do it .
it 's only what we find no one .
we 're going to find that hard value is going to make a technological value .
that 's where we have our clients .
that 's not what it is .
it 's amorph , it 's gone , and it 's down .
this is a way of building a regierungsauftrag to the next few years .
and then , you do n't have it back then .
there 's also some sort of effekt that can be easy to control , to make it .
in fact , the situation is , luftschiffe , a point in weltmarkt , so no market .
yet , we continue to do it .
it 's a world of the region .
the gesellschafter have made the force to do it .
now , the question is : what 's the question : what is the way we do it ?
how much money do we put in the weltmarkt ?
what do we do to do here ?
so what 's the way to do that ?
and i personally , they asked me to say , so , for a personal identity , i would be , of course , of course , when i wanted to go out of my vorgeschichte , where i would have been dornier , , the gegen of ,
i was also once with three of three years , when i was a vancouver , and when i was a vancouver , and i had this whole abrasierten of urwald , and it was like this ganzen urwald , i was so das about this .
and at the time , there was a spiegelatikelserie of communication that had been on the money , and no idea what to do , and it was n't going to be done .
i 've been told you how to do that .
and i 've been greenpeace for a while for a while , and i now , and i 'm going to do this in the first place to hope a erreichen future .
zero ? zero seconds . i 'll be in front seconds , i 'm ready , thank you .
morton bast
yeah , thank you very much .
these are my three points that i want to talk to you in the last few minutes .
why are we in im in the übermaß or in the way ?
how do we get to lebensfreude ?
and most of all , what ?
what 's going on here ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part of this is a bisschen .
but it 's also about to get the challenges .
a few years ago , there was a little more likely to explain this .
that we have a problem with a moment of white .
that 's where we have today .
but it still has to be over time , and it 's got to get back to this , and these are the challenges that we have to learn .
all kinds of umweltverbräuche are exponentiell .
if you see it in a recent long time , the ölverbrauch of the ölverbrauch , for example , is going to be a very short episode of history .
now , we can not imagine that it 's kind of a way of a lot like this , that it 's kind of going to go around and over and over .
you know about climate change , the last hundertfünfzig years .
some people say , `` well , before we 've been eiszeiten , let 's look at the last vierhundertfünfzigtausend years .
you can look at it as a find , but i 'm actually going to go on it .
you can also tell who , you need to go ?
you can also say that the ocean is far away .
but it 's still when you 're going to get a little bit of information about it , in a sense , to solve a lot of challenges , to do things that we really do , but we do n't just have trouble with the ernäherung , in
tropentage is about a long time of mars .
and there 's the level of things that we 're going to do in or cities , in our cities , in wien or wien .
but it 's also about the ernährungssituation vor , everything in asia .
think about the himalaya where the big ströme entspringen and the reisernten of the bottom is that there is the water out of the himalaya .
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is wurscht , which is what we do , and there 's lots of greater revolution .
and umwälzungen , but we 're going to get to the people who people are going to be in a very developing world in the very far way .
it 's about death .
now , interestingly , it turns out .
the süßwasser is getting less less than that .
that 's the aralsee , where a wesentlicher part of our baumwolle come .
and all of where is this ?
all of this bad things , i 'm going to get rid of you , one in the same way .
with what we 're building out of the world from the earth we harvest .
not only the oil and the metalle and the system , but the conditions are also zwar , but the last one is knapp .
and we should just want to look at it that we 're using things like this , but it 's a very simple way of doing the whole thing that we 've ever had to grow .
so it 's about the einleitung , which is actually the whole ressourcenverbrauch of the entire population of the entire field .
this is the challenge , not only , but not just only my two , umsteigen von of the car in a very real way of life .
different interactions .
our technology to change the ändern .
if we go back to the jäger and sammler , and there 's still on the earth that societies in cities that live in this place , that is that they come into a lot of cooperation in the year and every year .
in a agrargesellschaft , it was just about the längsten of the human story of the only five tons .
today , they 're fünfzehn to fünfunddreißig .
so verzwanzigfacht 's hat .
and it 's very , very ungleich distributed on earth .
it 's still more than we 're still in the rest of us , even more than we 're still more than the earth 's disease .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , a lot less .
and this is coming , we 're verlagern the effects of the way , the crows , the air is much better in the last few years , but it 's basically we 've been able to have this into other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world are doing now , it 's always less .
and so , the area that we see is that we have , from ukraine , of , , of afghanistan , and of course , look at it , and you look at the hinschauen of the geological geological and you see where the wo
and this is because of this particular thing , which is , of course , there are a lot of rohstoffe there , where the krisenherde are the krisenherde of the world .
so when we want to aufräumen it , we have to auseinandersetzen it .
so we really need to change the world that we have to have all over the world , all the way .
and what we 've seen here here is nicht tollem .
this is what he said , he said , he said , `` when he said , he said , he said , `` when he said it , has got the world , the world has been enough for 30 , but not for everybody .
and there we are , like , over the average life , there 's really interesting .
that 's how .
that was a sort of deprimierende deprimierende .
but i think it 's going to have to have a chance to get to the fact that it has to change it .
even though , when i say , it turns out there is about something like living in a way of living , which is more lebensfreude .
but it 's always again , again , again , from the komfortzone 'rauszukommen , you have to get a sag , i 'm going to be .
so , what is lebensfreude ?
and then we have to realize that in the parts of us in the world that are so much , we have to have this amount of , , gesellschaftlich of quality of life , but in fact , not often , we 're not oft at all .
this is a pretty good game , but it 's people , and they also know that people who ca n't deal with this story .
i 've heard about it .
burnout and climate have the same cause .
we 're working on a lot of work and intensiv .
this is on a side of us who 's stress , and it 's a lot of a lot .
i 'd like to do very well .
and on the other hand , we 're going to be able to be able to do that diesen .
what is it good for life ?
how can we define this ?
now , here 's a little bit of a wissenschaftlicher design .
now , as i said before , and what i 'm going to say later is , i think , is a little bit of a sozusagen , but here 's what it 's like to be here , but i 'm just going to be able to do
and that 's important to understand quality , and has some aspects of life .
life has the point of the impossible to me as a matter to what i am .
have i left the roof on top ?
did i have friends ?
did i have to be able to live in life ?
but also , how about that , what am i talking about ?
i sometimes ' , i sometimes sometimes the gefühlte quality .
and then i 'm going to give you two begriffe that are important to the point .
one is needs .
the need needs to be the very big dimension of human human development , and it 's on the way of feelings .
if we can share our needs , we are happy .
and you do n't need to be a sagen , you need to be needs or not sustainable .
you need not to do any need to win .
what is needed ?
you can hear different different , i 'm just two genannt .
and there is , of course , you know , physical density , but also , need to be a need for safety , for social relationships .
after oil , after partizipation , after muße , for creativity , for creativity , for empathy , for freedom , for freedom .
this is a little bit of money with money .
but it 's actually not a part of the major part , but the question is , how can i tell you in my life .
and i 'm in the second important term .
the gods .
the strategy that i would use to tell you is that i have to be able to get my needs .
and there it is there , then , that 's kind of a ressourcenverbrauch ressourcenverbrauch , and it 's got to do with a high school or a niedrigen .
and there must be a lot of money for some money .
so , i also have a kind of strategien like my own meine .
that has to do with my values , with the resources , the resources that i have .
if i have a little bit of money , i 'm going to try to make my own own , as i 've been trying to spend as much of money on a lot of time .
it 's about the grundbefürnisse , which is the roof above the head , eat food , and then you start looking at the höherwertigen .
and here we go , and it 's a little bit of oder , and it 's kind of like oder , and it can be used for unnachhaltig or unnachhaltig .
and if we get the whole strategien that gave me to pay for my needs , zusammenfasse zusammenfasse , we speak of a lebensstil .
so .
this was like , as a result of science .
and now , how much can we do now ?
how do we do it ?
and just just a couple of evidence .
of course , this must have to be anyone for themselves .
but the evidence in the individual type of a technological way , here , glaub , i 've been far out about technology , and also also in terms of ways .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
so the very first thing that we 've been talking about is the danger is that we 're going to have more resources more resources .
last of the quality of life has been abnimmt , because the effects are always worse , and so on , and that 's going to be schlagen .
or , if we can do it , in a way , a different kind of thing that 's going on less and less , but it 's less and less and less of the risk of quality .
there 's one of my favorite example , maybe that some of you who have seen the weizsäcker of this talk is more , , more quality of less .
there 's a lot of technology , how can i take any single thing that we use the computer , the orangensaft , the kaffee , the kaffee , the verkehr , the verkehr , the space , how can i make this way ?
i can make a zement , but i can create a haus to my house and house .
in order to get more and more and more lebensqualität .
my other teachers , friedrich-schmidt bleek , is hat the ausgedrückt , pro materialinput per serviceeinheit , and we 're at the right now today , which has been a little bit more , and it 's been so that it 's already on the business of the
where are the needs to be ?
so , how services can i really accept ?
and how can i do that with a little bit more möglichst ?
and it does n't have a little bit less than a little bit of a , , achtzig , neunzig percent less .
there 's many examples that can be familiar with this .
in wien , we have created a hochhaus in the middle of the hochhaus , in stockwerken .
seven stockwerken , at the top , there 's been built in vorarlberg .
that 's basically running out of wood .
you know , if you could n't do it in fünfzig , if you could n't get it back , and again , in the rest , and it would be back in the pieces of the same way , a lot of the resources that you would do
but it 's also a lot in our own , kind of , like , `` what am i doing ? ''
matthias binswanger has a beautiful book , die-tretmühlen-des-glücks .
where he shows how hard it is , of course , is really what happens to be out of the tretmühle .
the statustretmühle , i would want to abheben the other way around the other , and then i became a longer in this room in this room .
you 're like , like , ansprüche , i 've just befriedigt it , and then i 'm going to get the new .
the most famous thing i 'm going to do is the schönsten , the kennen .
when i started doing my research , i was going to have a couple of years ago .
and then you wait to be able to get to the letter until the letter now , i 'm e-mail e-mail , is ist wahnsinnige .
and for me , i 'm going to get hundreds of email .
and i can afford a lot more .
this is productivity , which is economic , we 're going to go back to that .
but i 'm not really gespart .
i 've done it for me .
but there are good examples of this kind of food , for example , where i really want to do the anspruch of the quality and the anspruch of the in .
and with a single ressourcenverbrauch of lebensqualität quality .
one of my favorite lieblingsbeispiele is simplify-your-life .
there 's now today , today , in fact , that ausgerechnet man is that person 's in the country , that they 've done about zehntausend things in the haushalt .
you can also start to count .
who was two , three generations , things , had employees , had angestellte .
we have that industry .
we have to klarkommen ourselves .
and there are always a lot of people who 's going to get this to all these things .
and take a ratgeber that helps us to help us dabei with these things .
i 'm interesting to say , maybe i 'm going to be interesting , i 'm not even more anwendung of the anwendung , but i 'm going to go to the zehntausend , i 'm not zehntausend .
the next example is , instead , have to use it .
it 's a real boom .
star star , time-magazine , cebit , has been used to have been developed in the world for 20 years .
in the meantime , there are always more people when they think about air-b-n-b .
if you think of why-own-it .
now , the way that you can do with the work that you can do with the things that we can have , what we 've been doing , is a little bit of a hier project , a die , a hundred years ago , that was a
that once , as a healthy , we could do better .
so , in fact , the final one is also a question of justice .
i did n't show you how they did this as a ungleich , that is taking the image between africa and europe and a gerechte gerechte .
so , with all , all at the same time , all the same way that you can do with the resources is actually possible if we can get less .
and this is not less risk , because of many of us have been a little bit of ourselves .
but it 's a important task problem , the economy , to support , these products , that they have to be able to create a good life with a lot of resources .
last story , it has also been doing something about the big economy in terms of growth , and i 'm doing it .
if you read a little bit about the principle , this is , of course , again , oecd , oecd , now the wifo of each week , this is going to be nach down .
it 's called , yes , a crisis is the next door of my view and also , as we 've learned about a lot of people , and they have been so busy , here are the numbers for österreich , they find that they
and there is no reason again , again , as i do this from my youth , from the sechziger years .
part of that has a lot of reasons .
one percent five percent of africa is so much of the average age of fünfzig years ago .
and the eight percent is that what china is today .
they 're about the places where we might have been fünfzig years ago .
so , if you 're bigger and more , less than 10 times more .
one percent is still a lot , so that 's where we 're going to do .
but you have to put a look at this , which is , no one , even if you have zero percent growth , you know , zero in the next year , would be so much different and und and income as it was in this year .
we can invest and we can work with it .
this is not so fast , because you 've got these statistics , which is that this is not going to do the progress with your quality of life .
the economy is growing , and the quality of living in ländern countries in the countries that we 're on .
and by the way , jobs are also possible to growth growth , and it does n't matter very close to all of us , again , as they all are called heißen .
it 's not just , and it 's also going to have to be with you that 's the time .
and it 's getting further and closer to more , even more wirtschaftsmagazine , like this , and next week , i 'm standing in here in the creation of a larger story , a story of the auseinanderzusetzen .
already , edward edward , , der damalige nobelpreisträger in his nobelrede damit auseinandergesetzt , who said that good life is the good economy , the good economy should serve of the good life .
that 's why it 's the end of it , and it 's not about the government to renditen the renditen , not to reduce it to the existing world .
for example , for those countries and such countries , for china , for india , this is a very different story .
and that 's also being gerechtigkeitsaspekten , and we 're going to grow up in the same way , and we 're going to look at it at the level of it , on the high level , on this level , on which we 're on , we
it 's also about politics .
it needs goals .
it takes braucht , sagen economists say .
it does n't require the same thing , but we should really look , and measure , and how does it work with the quality of change it is ?
is it the way ?
and then we have to choose our politicians .
of course , how far the ressourcenverbrauch is ?
how do we get it together ?
we need an enormous part of it , finally , to besteuern the und , and not work and work .
who 's who who 's who i 've been talking about these , but also , the arbeitnehmer , they know the good thing .
what kind of sozusagen control is that we have had to have a kollegen .
you could do something very different .
the resources are gehören , and they are the resources that are available and not for the resources .
and you need to get all the way to make the politikbereiche to work in order to sichern sichern , health , infrastructure , without electricity .
that 's , but you have to do a little bit better .
that means , fazit , more or less , in the deep , can not be able to work on the direction , we can be able to ask , as well , as a company , as a result , as a result , we need , what
do we need and we need to do it ?
the right politics is to give them the rahmenbedingungen .
i 've given a bunch of evidence .
and last of course , the science of neunundneunzig , the average neunundneunzig of all the geht are still in the direction , how can we make the growth ?
but unfortunately , nobody 's not there .
if you look at that , if you look at the area of the last 20 years , it 's still going down because it 's not going down .
politics does n't create , and the wirtschaftswissenschaft will not be growth , but it 's the question that 's going , let 's go , so that we have a good life of it ?
so , it 's got it .
`` the you , '' is the to .
with heart , brain , hand , hand and the end , we also need the spirit to make it more .
thank you .
i 'm ich salzburger .
and i love this city .
this city has so many stories .
one of them has been a few hundred years ago .
and it 's got to do with a problemlösung trend .
i 'm going to do that with a positive problem , and i 'll tell you about the story .
it 's going to have to do with mit hohensalzburg .
this is 'ne burg , who is here in the middle of the city , and a lot of this city is also ausmacht and prägt .
another story before .
it was a heißen called heißen in nevada .
so a man is looking at what she looks like in his feet .
that he was warm .
he 's europäer , he does n't know that as the heat .
he makes a sense of fackelt that he takes away from a schuh to a nicht , but it does n't work long , and it 's a lot of time .
he zieht the way back to his messer , and he sees a new climate in the form .
it 's the schuh , the quiet .
and this number you is here in here is the milliardäre in the forbes-liste der of mario today .
a company is entstanden , mit with letters .
one of you , or one of you , know it .
he actually has the original idea that we have just nike and adidas .
they have been writing .
so he says , `` well , fünfundneunzig , fünfundneunzig , i do my own business .
zweitausendvier is where we go to the market .
now today , i 'm going to have a lot of thousands of heute in the dreihundert dreihundert in the dreihundert community in the world 's most . countries .
that 's how much we need to do with a creative creative .
why not create something new , which is n't there yet ?
and mario may have said the question that wideg sich with wideg .
now , if you do n't know , even though , is it an opportunity ?
this question has already helped me , in a lot of fun .
if something is done that or my mitarbeiterin kündigt me , or i ca n't work or do n't do it .
wideg , small memory , wideg .
what is a chance ?
and you go from the problemdenken to the . .
what makes the difference to me , and this is the example .
and another interesting example was von from the schweizerischen mobiliar , and the zwar aussagen of aussagen .
and the evidence that as humans can be , as creative people can go , if they 're about their own food .
i want to show you a few examples here .
so , they actually actually had this sort of schweizerischen und , and the hat had done a daraus .
i 'm really excited about it .
my son did n't have the woman .
it 's just vorbeigerannt , so the woman 's durch through the luftzug . .
or i had eingekauft the pflanzen day , and i went to the kreuzung , and suddenly i was an actor in my blickfeld , and i could n't see the other car .
all right , who is it , is n't it ?
the bush .
the unfallzeugen are sind .
i was bin , and i had almost die .
i can tell you that at the end of the können half of können .
the last thing i did n't do was i was in the accident .
it was the young woman in frau .
if you 're a man , every one explanation does anybody .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so human beings , we 're creative .
and i wish i and i dream that we use use more of creativity .
many of us are in a einer freizeitorientierten .
and that does n't have to be that way .
why not only do that simple to anything else ?
and the old things that we 're doing is that we 've been going to have to be die , which might be familiar with überfordern , or the opposite .
why not only do that , as a result of the als , as little as the einfache .
and there 's so much like that companies to use .
for example , gastronomen gastronomen , but they have diese a-ständer , and they do n't have the same or they go to the center of the show , and this is what 's going on .
also a possibility , right ?
it 's like , you know , it 's going to be a kaffee .
or something .
we do n't have a w-lan , we 'll have unterhaltet .
now , i 've been ungewohnt , right ?
if you ca n't make the phone out there ?
or eat it to me , maybe we both both .
frech , but creative .
it 's got to do something about it .
i 'll get the one of the ones that i would have to reingehen and say , okay , okay , i do n't know that .
that 's what i 'm doing .
a deutsches seminarhotel in the herrentoilette die aktuelle aktuelle , and zwar in sichthöhe .
once even the einmal news is news , news .
if you were three times more about it , it 's topinformiert .
once again , the bekamen beschwerde over the long time they eat .
it 's a denkmalgeschütztes building , and it 's very small , so it 's got to have all the hands of it .
it was too deeply .
you have to think , what do you do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we can not grow faster and in the kitchen .
here 's the idea .
on the other hand , there 's a aufgestellt strauß aufgestellt frisches frisches frisches salz and pfeffer .
so , the gäste gäste in the wartezeit of the food auf schon essen .
just a different .
a creative idea , and perhaps not solved with wideg-frage .
there is a person who is not just beliebt .
it 's this person in the führungskraft of the lokführer , so the gewerkschaft of the lokführer .
and now aktuell are bahn .
already the second day , it 's going to be , , right ?
a company is going to have to weselsky klaus weselsky for the mitarbeiter of the month , and they may be familiar with some of the time .
a transportunternehmen says , `` klaus , we thank you .
people come to us in buchen .
it 's the busse , it 's full of betrieben , and people in the world , people are fahrgemeinschaften , and because of course , every one of the other things , of course , it 's kind of b , b .
but why not yet use the same thing that we do and make a look at your mind ?
sometimes , you know , creativity also ungeplant .
and it 's coming from a hoppla vielleicht , like that companies like maybe that you may know .
so we have said that we do n't really mean that the smartphone-sparte smartphone-sparte is n't really good , but it 's also going to have to save the übersetzern that we need to save .
or , in the car , in the car .
and we 've seen all the different flieder , and we all have to wait .
yes .
why not nicht a piece of speck in the car if you 're at dadrauf ?
or with ortstafeln , there are opportunities to be able to make the difference .
and all of that has just done with humor , with fun , sometimes sometimes with , , ne ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once my zweieinhalbjähriger son was in my office office .
and he 's on the drehstuhl vor me .
so , we 've got a lot of drehstühle around the world .
and then he 's talking on the left , on his left , he has sex , and i 've been talking to my blöden 's saying that you 're listening , that 's not the middle one .
he too me looking at me , and i look at you , and i look at the big eyes .
and in the moment , i 'm actually going to have the right , is it ?
why is that a spielplatz ?
why is this thing we do to do not the good for adults ?
that 's a bit more sinnvoller , right ?
if we 're careful , if we use our instructions , that 's what we 're trying to do .
and it 's been erzielen , but it 's very entspannt .
the eigenartige is that if there 's a second day , it 's going to happen to what is happening in our brain .
it 's the first day in week , and somehow , our focus on a different day .
we 'll have another one day day .
that 's the weekend .
you know , it sounds like the media .
in donnerstag , it 's just a day or a day .
or if that 's the time , the world 's first came up , and it 's coming .
so what are the restlichen couple of weeks ?
is it so terrible ?
do we all have that jobs ?
it was a kultmagazin 's first time in front of it , which is a subject .
yes , i can sleep , i will tell you all the rest .
or on instagram , on facebook , on the social networks , it 's going to be this issue .
and even in durch , i ich myself into the , , one of the haupteinkaufsstraßen in in .
there 's a lot of businesses , and i look at the same thing .
so what that 's like in the auslage , was , is there so ?
and one day , i was going to buy this one with these some zum .
and the first wave you see here , yes , that 's actually very well .
so , with the way , that 's how to use love .
i also know that this is a von of five kids , but i also have my job now .
yes .
or even more effective , for free , the ist is . .
why is your own attitude , which is a lot of manifestiert , and it 's still getting more and more and more .
somebody has ever been thinking of this way , because it 's not the gepostet , it 's your jobs , it 's your jobs .
and i actually even actually brille with the black and come here and come and say , okay , put it .
what 's my job is ?
the joke is , even if the dinosaurs are ist , it looks all the same way .
so , nice to be something that 's not beautiful , does n't seem so much .
the black workers are actually super off the bus .
there is a wunderbar that 's going to fly the way back to the room .
but sonstigem did n't taugt .
where does it matter to us when we do n't change it ?
actually the job , the content , the inhalt ?
within the company , outside of selbständiger .
it could be done in a system where we feel like a mouse .
the mouse is going into a inside and it 's going and it 's going to be and it 's going to get it up and slow down , and then it starts to get slow down , and then it 's going to get it the little bit
what makes the mouse mean ?
they do n't know anything else , they go back in the hamsterrad .
and again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , a film täglich , you know , murmeltier murmeltier , you know , you know , you know , you think of it .
this is beautiful gepolstert , and here is heu , so it 's got there , and it 's still going up , and it 's going to go .
and the thing that as we feel , as a boy , is what a mouse has ever been gehirnerschütterung ?
or something does that , for instance , is umdenkt .
i was so much ago , and i was walking out of a seminar after a week .
and once in the '60s , the streets were unter in my mind , it was a black vor before my eyes and i have to thank you .
the next day , i went to the doctor , because i thought , `` well , what ?
he looked at me and said , well , no , it 's okay .
but how do you look at the stressniveau ?
and i looked at my kalender to see that , and saw , i was just three hours through my own room , and i kind of nervte myself the job .
after six years , in weiterbildungsbranche and , , who have been the first thing that we should have at the end of the day .
did i thought , `` well , what 's going on ? '' is there still ?
and it was hab , umzudenken , other people to try , and look at another time , looking for me to my family verbring , a good good for me .
überleg , if there 's no 'ne other betätigungsmöglichkeit in my job , for a new funken .
i was gemerkt , talking to the groups of any good groups .
i 'm going to go out and i 'm talking about it and i 'm talking about it and other other things , but i 'm going to be able to give you all these things , but i 'll be able to share these talks to share with
and that was n't always the way .
i 've got some of you to see that this dauernde stress is sick .
and sometimes , it 's got to have the diesen of the den before , so , from me , trainerkollege was from me to the entlassen , after he was going to go back to the hospital , after a heart heart disease , and he starts to
and as i said , she went to joggen me , she always mich me , she 's got me to be , you know , you go with you , and you go .
it 's going to fall .
so , with walkingstöcken , with slowly , in the real pulsbereich , in the same , we 're still going to go to gemeinsam .
what happens ?
the bottom line is , we 're all going to grow .
the krankenstandstage go down , but a curve that is , of course , is the lack of psychischer .
gesamt minus four percent in the zirka last 10 years ago , almost minus minus percent , which is beautiful , this is going to be less .
zunahme of disease , diseases of zweihundert .
that 's something that i think is , has to be such a way ?
why is that ?
is this just in education ?
no , even in germany , it 's so .
atmungssystem , kreislaufsystem , that 's all better .
this is what we see here in the left-hand side .
at the bottom of the world , we do n't have to grow a hundred percent of the last 10 percent in the last 10 years , a new deutsche vesicherung .
the number of verschriebenen is verschriebenen .
it costs the cost .
and it 's all sorts of offiziellen , and what can we do about this topic ?
and sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , things are also going to be entstehen into this kind of unfreiwillige , like , here 's the way .
so it 's good .
and somebody once said that there is no alkohol .
but what is the solution ?
what is it that makes us bring us healthy and make and make joy ?
and that has been the last beschäftigt .
i 've been thinking about , is there a little bit more like this , i do n't know ?
i 'm a draufgekommen , the job is not the point of being uns and just going to be happy .
there are a lot of other things that are important , family , health , faith and so on .
but the fact is that , in fact , we 've got the biggest part of our wachzeit in the work .
and if we do that , why do n't do that , that it 's not enough to us and others .
i 'm going to give you the heut and i 'm going to have to have this as a number of time to you , and to ema-prinzip .
these little abkürzungen , you know , i think , hopefully that you have to make a difference .
tufu is about umsetzung , freedom and environment .
this means , `` how do i get my secrets ? ''
so what do i do in the environment ?
so , what do i have to do with the freedom that i want to do ?
because the level of the fremdbestimmung that we uns .
the more of it , the more davon .
and what do i do ?
it 's the umsetzung .
that 's where they 're stehen , they 're in charge areas .
and you can see everybody for yourself .
i had to take it for myself a few years ago , and i would try to get back the back again .
can i have my talente ?
what about the environment ?
and that 's sometimes sometimes i 'm going to be out with a toy with my laptop , i think it 's going to be seminar , or a votrag .
freedom .
and freedom , i can tell you how to deal with .
and i 'm going to do that ?
that 's the way .
the last commandment .
and then there are always people who tell me why i do n't go .
and why this is a lot harder to do .
then i would like to think of that , to an answer .
who wants to find out there .
who is n't , of course .
and spätestens at the point that you can have aussuchen of , i 'm going to have , i 'm going to have , or do i have to know ?
and they 're right there .
so what do we do with our talenten ?
every one of them has taken his great schatzkiste .
it 's much too too small .
it 's filled with talenten , with gold with everything , with all kinds of things with your skills .
what do we do ?
spätestens , spätestens , is a question of jahresende .
or if we 're in the hospital or the end of the life .
what did i have done with my talenten ?
but by the way , who is auf on salzburger kann , they 're still zugreifen .
so , what we 're going to do with is our first question , which is my first question , even in itself , but in every day .
do i have enough good enough ?
and the resources .
there 's still with a story .
i wanted to tell you about salzburg .
and the möcht i 'm going to do .
this is the festung that was rettung to the salzburger than the zirka als zirka years ago .
and the taliban believed that these festung were so built , that they could n't meet them .
dicke walls steile , raufführen raufführen to the türen , dicke doors , verriegelt mehrfach .
it was uneinnehmbar at the time .
so this is what happens to be thought , if we do n't get it out , if we do n't , then we have a belagerungsring .
we do n't get it out there .
just look at the same time that i ran out there .
the salzburger were all of the day a day where the vorräte were almost verbraucht .
they were only one stier of the time , and they were already on the way that they were going to be geschlachtet to the hauptmann , and they give me a few tage to me , and i 'll give you three days .
bischof , okay , hauptmann , you bewährt you , you know me , you 're going to come up , take your stier and make us .
hauptmann is about the stier .
in a way , the enemies of the bottom of the festung are a stier , and it 's going to be geführt by the left to the in .
well , think about that , a stier , which is that .
it 's mittags .
again , a wird herumgeführt will come up to the der of the festung , and this is black .
you think , you know , oh , that 's where two noch es , you know , there 's two dauern , there 's no one there .
so , again , the same scenario again , again , again , this is white , which is weiß at the top of the und , which is geführt .
at the end of the second day , after six six stiere stiere , they 've gone down in a nacht-und-nebel-aktion .
because they thought that would take us too long , we do n't think about ourselves .
after then , the salzburger went down to the und and wuschen the stier .
they give them and they sie them .
they 've come up with salzburger salzburger .
i liked this idea that everything else is there , we need .
sometimes it 's more resources , sometimes it 's not a lot harder , sometimes it 's not a lot harder .
but again , we can do something about that .
we have no idea of what we do , to do the whole day .
and if you think that , well , this could be a good schlusssatz , and it 's right .
this is the spring .
that 's coming .
and we in mitteleuropa knowledge that the da is there , there 's a little bit more of the 's going down with the pflanzen of braunen braunen braunen to green .
there 's blüten blüten in this morning , diesen .
there 's a lot of sehr here , which we have , and eat the food .
there are the air that we have to have the land of this bubble , mahlen and bread .
there are some animals that eat the food .
there 's people who are produkte , the ones that the products will eat .
and it 's automatisch .
but if you think about it , maybe that 's not just as possible , it 's a fear and bange .
and of course , this threat is not only something , and it also does n't matter , but in the area of the blüten , the connection of the water to the plant is bienen a lot of very large .
there are research that show that at achtzig to our prozent percent of our food , especially food that would not be if we had no bees .
it sounds like that , because it 's so normal to us because it 's that normal , and it 's not that we can not see it .
there was a very interesting interesting there , a few years ago , more-than-honey ,
and i 'm going to make it look at you .
now , let 's look at the gentleman teichmann , which is teichmann , at the same time , with the schulzeit , in which deutlich deutlich the world .
this is what he 's doing here in a school in überlingen , and he 's now going to tell us a lot about his work .
please , mr. teichmann .
yes , good evening .
only a big thank a great thank short , and reichert an .
that i am in my own project , das-fliegende-klassenzimmer beziehungsweise 's bienen-machen-schule is a little bit about the life of the bees .
and again , just one of a flügel is a little bit of a little bit about a little bit about little bienenwesen , which is fun .
because i want to get the fact that the reason that you would have been tätig , and it 's been there to be a hoffnungsloses hoffnungsloses in the next few minutes .
i do n't do that . no .
but maybe i 'm going to take you to make it that you 're beginning to have this flügelwesen , or you 're going to have to help some of you , empathie it , you 're trying to read it for this weisheitsvolle , staatenbildende insekt of der
my name is thomas teichmann , and i was achtundfünfzig achtundfünfzig with a wonderful woman , with the children of five children , who was n't enkelkindtauglich of und children , and ausbildungen abgeschlossen and studiengänge , and in the und years of working
i 'm a member of mitglied in im , and i verein the verein .
and work now , in the brachenreuthe oberhalb , oberhalb oberhalb of mit with our oldest students in the werkstattjahr .
we work in there in agriculture , and agriculture .
das-fliegende-klassenzimmer is actually a theaterstück of erich kästner , and from raufenden schulklassen .
our fliegendes classroom is more friedliche , a silence , a quiet thing .
and it 's also easy .
it 's almost a poetisch-lyrische issue .
and not free , for the scientists , the relationship between honey are < honig griechen , and the wortkunst melos wortkunst .
and in a wonderful vers of homer , he explains how he sonnengott the musen of his musen apollon seine to the inspirieren to make sure that he can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
but the musen are not going to go on , but they send their eggs and bees and the benetzen nun nun and kriechen in the mouth in the morning and ihm out the words of honey from honey .
it 's a beautiful picture .
hopefully that i 'll tell you the next moment .
yes .
that 's going to be a fliegende .
i come to the project .
one of these schaukästen , this bienenschaukästen , who is now only students that i 've spent my students with me for dreißig for zweiunddreißig days .
in benachbarte schools , from von to us in the gymnasium or the die in the hauptschule of owingen or in the waldorfschule .
it 's eine to föhrenbühl or föhrenbühl in uns .
the teacher who 's going to end with me that are in the class , and we 're looking for a passenden space for this .
most of the window of the kids can do the same thing as the month .
and before all of these things , the bees , the ones that go there , they 're hineinfliegen out of the und .
it 's going to be a öffnung .
so .
and that 's where all of you do .
so , i 'm going to take a bienenschaukasten , and i 'm going to put it in a bestehenden , two waben waben , and you 're going to put them in here .
so , on this level , on this level , are arbeiterinnen bees .
and , what 's also , we have verdeckelte brut , and here 's going to be here , again , the rand are going to have to be more brut , so dry eggs .
and then there 's a , , there 's a futterkranz .
there 's the honey inside there .
you need to take it if you 're bad , and you ca n't fly .
that 's how .
this is what it looks like .
and then the hier drauf down here , and immediately starts to the transport of the dafür of things , or an space .
and it 's a wonderful thing .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees and put things in the class , have a crisis .
they do n't care of people .
they 're einsam .
you do n't find your queen .
and that 's the most important thing about imker , if he schaukasten his diesen that he 's wearing the queen 's old people .
so that 's not what they 're sitting on .
and you 're sad , these bees .
they begin to heulen .
yes , the imker says they 're heulen .
you hear that .
they 're almost a oktav higher than if they 're normally in the bienenvolk with a queen .
and now it 's a neuorganisation .
ladies and gentlemen , now , in a night , you 're going to develop the need to take the new people , a new people , and they do n't have any kind of prozessbegleitung , , , no ohne , no
here 's the people coming in , and then they have a königinnenzelle in the first night here .
because no queen would n't exist in that car six months .
because sommerbienen only only live for two weeks .
this is how it goes .
and in that first night , they take a aus out of a waben , and they bring it into that königinnenzelle .
and then , if you get the queen , i 'll give you the queen .
everybody who was given in front of the biologie-leistungsfach , who said , should it like ?
yes , genetisch vorbestimmt are all of everything .
that 's true .
and it starts a wonderful thing .
this is normally what 's actually going to be here in the eine of a königin .
this is the first three days of the sea , the first . code , the arbeiterinnen sea .
after that , you 've got a little bit of von from a . .
you know that term .
and immediately , on the made , you can see the genetic code in the fünfhundertfünfzig .
the methylmarker are werden by the methylsäure in in .
we 've already seen this before that what we eat , which means what comes from us .
and the queen is really really wonderful to experience .
so three days out , five days ago .
and this is the students who will all be schüler .
you see this in the unterricht .
and then , cell phones will be mit of a wachs , and it does n't happen , because the people will go back to the entschließt , or because of a sudden , it says , `` if you 're a diktatorisch , you 're supposed to be
no , that 's einmütig .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a einmütiger or a entschluss .
and then finally , for eight , every day of all of my students , know , five , five , a woman , he 's tage tage königin days of the queen .
and on the day , if that is to say , the teacher has got the aufgeschrieben in the bienenbuch , and he 's klingeln the uhr in the morning , at the morning , at the morning , in five o'clock , yes .
and then the mother said , `` what is it with you ?
yes , i have to come in school .
yeah , why is that ?
yes , our queen 's . .
yes ?
and then the morning is in the school .
and then they drücken their nasen platt at this point because they want to be miterleben , like the queen is now . .
and if you can do it , you 'll hear a little bit .
this is the queen pfeift .
so .
there 's a little higher .
and then the ammenbienen and the schneiden get the queen up .
the first one , which this is , you take all your time , and you can go out with your duftdrüsen on this , which is what you have a queen on the front of you , you know , your parfüm , your parfüm
the people has now a identity now .
it 's now three to five times five days .
and from the ammenbienen , they kriegt the gelée .
back at the back , the kot comes out , from the people , from this schaukasten .
and for five , this is the königin einmalig of the queen .
now a couple of think now , yeah , i 've seen it , like a bienenschwarm in im .
wait , stopp .
something completely different .
that 's what we 're doing .
this is the queen , when the königin is n't there , no bodyguards , from this schaukasten to the zwei to 20 miles .
i 've already seen it in their zeppelin .
in the drohnensammelplätzen and the in , there 's a begattungsakt begattungsakt in dort , from seven to 12 drones , the poor bees .
so , like , in the way , in the way where the man 's different women have here , the queen is the queen , the seven to 12 men .
and this is happening all in a way .
the drone is coming from the back , this guy , and the queen is now moving into this einmaligen hochzeitsflug , all the königin that she 's out of seeds around the years to three eggs .
for the drone , it 's a einmaliges experience .
if you go out of the car you die , you 're dead and you die dead from the sky .
and then the queen goes back and start to get eggs .
there 's always one , two students in the class who see that .
so , the queen is going to go to the queen .
yes .
and then slowly , the first step in school is now the werden again , and the queen and the und and the queen 's going to be , and it 's going to be out of the stage .
and then i would come back to that night , and that 's when i went to a night .
verschließ ' and flugloch the next morning , and i 'm going to go through the königin , and i 'm going to put this schaukasten with the queen and the bees to me .
and there you see the queen there .
yes .
frisch geschlüpft .
and it 's drumherum 10 to 10 ammenbienen .
and then this comes , these two waben here , here , is here in a bienenzarge .
in a in of in , and now , the beute and the kann can be the number of things .
why do bees do bees ?
ladies and gentlemen , the children who have ever had this , that never happened .
yes .
it 's not just that , in that class , the students who are doing all the time in the bees are together , and the whole school comes into this class .
and the teacher , when he knows anything , if he can do something , he 's got a little bit better than he 's got a epoche on the other side .
look , bees and 'ne geschichtsepoche , siebzehntausend years ago , we have höhlenmalereien höhlenmalereien , where people have already seen the honey .
a few months ago , in the dreitausend , a few years ago , we found this in tonröhren , and we found that the people were getting the bees together .
every human culture , mit itself .
or the way , the bees are in each culture .
in china , in india , in persien , in egypt , in egypt , in italy .
all of them were .
the other cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are vergangen .
he can genetik-epoche a genetik-epoche , a zoologie-epoche anschließen , can be able to anschließen a botanik-epoche .
ladies and gentlemen do you know what the flowers or the trees are bienen the bees , the trees ?
now , you know , there 's now in the summer now in the summer in the u.k .
this is out there , this is a green desert for the bees .
yes ?
he can go back to the in in the schulgarten and there will buy the plants and the plants , and they like to markieren the plants , and they go out there , and how long can we do the lange of the bis to the flowers ?
how long would you spend on your own blüten ?
and for how long need to take them out again , and they 'll get back again .
he can veranstalten 'ne veranstalten .
how do i get a sechseck ?
yes .
you know , if that 's so much in the bienenvolk is the top to the top , or 'ne is flache to the top .
look at this .
he can do a mathematics -- a eine anschließen .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can even mit the nobelpreisträchtigen schwänzeltanz in the waben .
and then he says , `` well , how about karl karl , nobelpreis , at the end of karl neunzehnhundertvierundsiebzig ?
because he realized that the bees will see this in the bienenstock .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a ist , it 's stockfinster .
it looks a bit like a biene .
and just the professor tautz , who has been a lot of jahre at the university of many of the people who have made of in , is that the bees will have a tanzboden on their individual auf .
a ein like a gespanntes web aus on the waben on the nun , and now zweihundertvierzig with the hertz hertz abgeben and abgeben , and the bees , the dadrumstehen , the aufnehmen with your legs , with their fühlern .
see what they do in the school ?
it 's handlungspädagogik par , and it 's always your kids will get their fear .
and so it 's a achtsamkeit for the bees .
they learn , hinzuhorchen , , , whatever the bees do .
and you get a achtung into these creatures , which is basically only for us people .
the bees are not schaffen , a kilo per number of people in the year .
hundertfünfzig years ago , the only way to create electricity .
they 're going to go to the outside outside the trees outside the trees .
this is a knospenharz , mit kitten sie .
now , imagine again , in summer , this is sechzig -- a lot of bees -- a lot of bees in a engen space , bei fünfunddreißig .
hey , there is infektionskrankheiten without it .
no , no bees do n't .
because they have natural antibiotics in this propolis natural sky .
they collect the pollen , and they dadurch it down , and it 's going to ihn it , it 's zum to a . .
someone who 's an about the , is lungenentzündung bronchitis , pseudokrupp der can go to a imker , to look at a verschreiben by verschreiben the stockluft out of the people .
of course , there 's a gitter there , and with 'nem with a atemmaske and so on , there 's nothing .
yes , and then my brother and gentlemen , the bestäuben of the nutzpflanzen , are n't going to do it , and we have less äpfel when the bees are n't going to fly , or we would have
there 's a lot more different way .
look at the weißklee , because there 's a draußen in the wiese , and the kühe is ist on the weiden , where the cows are grasen .
and there 's the inside , the wheel goes down and down to these diesen , and these diesen fermentiert .
and now the cow come and frisst the weißklee and only , because they 're weißklee weißklee aufnimmt , they 're actually verdauen .
yes ?
and then they käut that again and merkt , and i was , ah , i was weißklee weißklee , ah , i can do it again .
and then there is milk .
that 's what that means .
yeah ?
and at the end of the day , the following schenkt tells us the most important thing that we have in nature .
the honey .
i 'll just come to a moment , inklusion .
my students look at each time every year when they build and teilweise , and i 'm going to be part of you in the schools .
now , that 's my favorite example , and i had a student who was a student at me , and i said in the biologie-hörsaal in the gymnasium room in überlingen , and i said , `` okay , you 're going to dich yourself .
and then he says , yes , yes , i 'm hot .
i come from unkel in bonn , and i 'm for 20 years .
and i 've been brachenreuthe for five years , and for two years , in the . .
and i 'm happy to say that i do n't have to learn more of the ömme to me , but i can learn to know .
ömme , yes , with the head .
and a raunen went through the hörsaal , oberstufenschüler gymnasium .
and half of half said , oh yeah , we want to do that .
my students today , they have an incredible sense of economic and und between zwischen , in anführungszeichen , in the behinderten of the people who are aufgehoben around .
on augenhöhe , they 're sich and they 're being selbstbewusstsein , my students , to be proud of a . .
how do you go to the monster ?
the question is wrong .
you 'd want to say , how do you get to the bien ?
and that 's where i 'm , there is also the person who impulsiert the other people , and there 's a new bienenvolk .
and he says he 's like , start with .
at the end , a small poem of hilde from domin .
who would like the sound , the sun would feel the sun through the wolkenhimmel and never nie the weight of the felder in ewigem glanz , as long as he did , he would smile .
thank you .
hello , love friends in all the world .
welcome to my slide 's mine .
the project of my first and my wife .
it 's the fight for the end of the female genitalverstümmelung .
in my eyes , the biggest crime of humanity , because it was tobt years old .
society is women with the women who are still used to be in opfern .
first of all , i imagine .
my name is rüdiger . i come from hamburg .
and i ran the eine .
you can think of me , that the job is n't job .
i felt i felt .
and so i was very happy that i was going to go out to auskannte survival and spannende .
for example , this one .
with a massive baumstamm over the atlantic of africa , brazil .
on the segel , a appell an at the brasiliens brasiliens of the völkermord freilebenden den den letzten yanomami .
that was a walk where i was more uboot than a , , more , , more als .
yet , there was so much like this to make sure that the media of the media works , and even a small person , i could make my life in the language .
neunzehnhundertsiebenundsiebzig , i took my own karawane die in ethiopia .
in that , there was the zwischen between eritrea and ethiopia , and we were augenzeuge augenzeuge of this .
and despite all that we did n't know we did , we were on the other side of unendliche , the unendliche gastfreundschaft of the muselmanen that uns us from arabische arab .
and twice , it was that we were überfallen and we were using the two things that you see here , with your bodies as a lebende lebende , and the angreifern said that were my gäste .
if you want to kill you , you need to get rid of yourself .
in fact , something that i found was in the other culture .
and then in the back of young years later , you 've been told that you ca n't reduce economic policy .
also , we do n't mean christians do n't be limited by on terrorism .
for example , the indianer-ausrottung .
the inquisition , the kreuzzüge .
but rather than just the other values of like social , die responsibility .
these are the values for fight it 's too .
for years , i 've been living in this danakil-wüste , , with my wife .
and then we heard the von wahnsinnsverbrechen female .
and then i heard that neunzig percent of the new victims are the number of christians and those are the number of christians and andersgläubige , i thought , `` how could a weltreligion like the neben should be better than the noch '' and then unwidersprochen unwidersprochen schuhe
and the idea was born , the highest , of course , have got to get the need for islam to be zur .
we were looking at dafür in the organizations , and we 've not found it .
so we had to hear now , now , as soon as durchgeknallt , that 's probably not dialogfähig .
you would durchschneiden me the kehle .
on anraten international , we had kurzerhand our own organization .
and it was von and bedenkenträgern .
and now , for example , this struggle is to even be able to win some of us .
it was a lack of a bestand .
and that 's why und and i went out of this desert to make a camera camera with the camera .
the bad blutigen pictures i 'm going to do not show you , but i want to make the verbrechen . .
girl at the age of four weeks to be born from your parents and their friends and auf , on the ground , you 're going to go back to the gliedmaßen , and you 're not going to klitoris your klitoris and you
what 's left is , it 's a öffnung from the size of a reiskornes .
now , let 's add a viertelstunde .
if you 've got the rule , you 'll be going to get two weeks .
and zerstört zerstört on body and soul was beraubt .
this was the beginning of what we call the sogenannten pharaonischen .
it 's going to be more hochzeitsnacht .
the man must open up .
he never saw a unbekleidete woman .
the onkels haben said he said , `` ibrahim , '' is not a problem .
you reibst your penis with vaseline , and then they decided hard .
and if you do n't make it , it 's not bad .
you take it through , and you put them .
this is pharaonische verstümmelung .
it 's a third of the girl die .
you had three months months .
schock schock was lost her language .
these are the verstümmelungsländer , but some in asia .
most are regiert sind .
and when we asked to say why did you do that ?
and the meistgegebene answer , we need to do that , in the koran .
there 's nothing in the koran of it , right in the opposite .
each gläubige bekennt a day in their own gebet , like a allah , , , the right , is perfect , perfekt .
but they do n't seem to believe what they 're talking about .
she unterstellen allah , a ein pfuscher , who was women 's geschaffen falsch , and why you could have been a mickriger , as a an , , women .
but now we had the first one of the first mitstreiter war .
he gestattete us , his whole clan-führer zusammenzutrommeln to a konferenz .
there was hard to have two days .
but we had the gesundheitsminister on the side , the highest scheichs on our page .
and then the great decision , the need is against all human rights against religion . we think we need to use it .
last recently , the way of dieses this new stammesgesetz unterschrieben .
and if you know africa and the stammesgepflogenheiten , you know , only that has been used for these people .
and it was gefeiert , and it was also what we 've been in other countries .
so , for example , again , mauretanien , gestattete höchste uns uns us to the höchste geistliche , the großmufti of the country , it 's a crime to write in fahnen and nun it into the oasen .
we were back to our lab , with our own . .
we had hundert .
and where we came , we just have open colors , open arms , and the , , gastfreundschaft gastfreundschaft .
and when we wanted to leave the country , the big bang and großmufti rüdiger , you just want to look at all of these countries ?
there are no such going to be a little bit of lebenszeit there .
he 's right .
i 'm achtzig , and there 's got to be a little bit about this .
and it was a idea .
he said , if he is able to take the first person to get rid of the world to make a table , and explain the discovery of sünde , then it 's a sünde .
annette and i flew to kairo , and i went to the moschee , and the vergleichbar mit .
and in allerhöchsten , for theologisches , the recht , the großmufti professor , we got a privataudienz .
he heard the idea at begeistert , especially when we garantierten it that we would take it .
and that 's what we 're doing about förderer , which is support to us .
and then he said , `` i 'm not going to do the conference not like moderieren , which we 've asked to , but i 'm going to take the schirmherrschaft .
and that 's what he did .
over the course of the irgendwann of the irgendwann of the transparente , our transparente were . .
international gelehrtenkonferenz to verbot the body of the female body of weiblichen körpers bodies .
under the schirmherrschaft of the president professor , martin ali .
and they 've got them .
a hundred bodyguards , but the highest of the world .
in the middle of the katar in the face , the man has einreiseverbot in in hamburg , and on the rest of europe , he 's the verursacher of the wegen of the karikaturen .
so men who can be alive and lives .
but also , the other ones .
on the left side of the left , the rechts on the left , on the right , my schirmherr .
the biggest of the world .
and i think about it , i 'm going to make a vakuum a lot of und .
and then they all sie .
it started getting a conference .
and from our schild at the top of the links großmufti , on egypt .
the großscheich al-azhar of the ägypten , , frau of wife and mubarak rüdiger , germany .
so much of the success , islam is not dialogfähig .
we also had a lot of a geladen way to look at their own , but that 's what you feel women with as a mit of mit .
and then they had ihren the film .
reality .
the men had feuchte eyes .
they went back behind the türen to the united states , only two hours , they decided and they had a eine , a rechtsgutachten .
the mufti tritt , the vor kameras , which you 've decided to do .
and the most recent sentence in this was , this was the one .
female genitalverstümmelung is an verbrechen crime that das against the values to the values of islam .
he unterzeichnete the fatwa .
we thought , well , the job is done , but it does n't have the case without the wirte .
because the one is talking about the woman 's disease is more than anybody .
that 's why we have nachgeschoben .
we 've got this one that we 've been called in the book of the book .
a predigtvorlage for the imame of the world .
and because ali ali , the schirmherr es , was a good thing to think of it , he wrote it , with a gesegnet .
it 's going to come from the hands .
we had had to have done in many countries , we 've had the highest islands on them .
and they were able to tell that with some of them , so they were das by the book .
but unfortunately , most of them do n't have the courage to aufgebracht the mut .
you do n't talk about the woman 's wife , you 're not talking about the moschee .
only a couple of aufgebracht have got your courage .
they 've gone at the university of marktplätze .
and sometimes we have found some imame mutige , which actually , in fact , about gepredigt , are here .
and then it goes beyond lautsprecher on the frauenabteilungen .
and these are the individuals .
it will spread .
but i 'm going to do time for the time .
it 's all tropfen down , and that 's why i work at a lot of other ways that we have today .
it 's a brauch .
but my non-plus-ultra-vision would be this .
i want to tell you the great news of the great news of the world , in the verkünden , in fact , in the kaaba of islam , here in the 1970s .
it 's like an 's 'nem müden , but in the hauptpilgerzeit .
if there 's four million people working together , men and women islamische islamische .
then i 'm talking to all the all and the king king of my farm , and the transparent spannen .
now , as i 've done this , i 've been able to trainiert this in fotomontage .
unfortunately , i have the last one of the , , , which is the king king .
but i 'm sure when he 's going to erführe it .
one of the women who women are to help us .
for the other , to show the world of the real world of the truth , which is the real values of islam , instead of doing it to the whole world .
from terrorists as terrorists .
if i do n't get the schaffe , i can do this thing , which i saw in the premiere .
that in particular , many of the imame in the world are listening to all of the world .
and we could unser it with it .
and maybe i 'm going to erlebe it , i do n't give you that girl do n't have to have his wife .
then , my life has been so richtig .
and i want to come up to anybody who has been heard now , or have seen , mitzumachen .
not yet , it 's not a mittäterschaft .
we need to get the transition to tonne , because the one hand is because of the stage .
and i want to show you the kind of entwurf of the process that i 've been doing .
this is my annette , my mitstreiterin .
and that is in all around the world , the arabisch is in the allahs of the allahs , and the das allahs of the muss .
and then we have it down in july .
female genitalverstümmelung is about the one of the koran and the ethik of islam .
it 's gottesanmaßung and it 's a diskriminierung of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm going to start with that .
this is how the essenspakete aus of them got home .
on the dreiundzwanzigsten side , my mother , my brother , my sister and i , i know , sort of paket .
it roch bestialisch .
my mother was totally entsetzt because she did n't understand why we had vergammeltes food .
the third day , we finally aufgeklärt aufgeklärt .
and we were going to go back to the stuff , and we would have to go back to this stuff , and then we would have a albanische woman , and we just got it gegen das .
they tried to explain us , `` hey , you can eat .
that 's not verdorben .
it turns out it 's good .
it 's a käse .
my mother moved to the augenbrauen , and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own , we have ziegenkäse ziegenkäse , which has n't been so vergammelt .
i 'm suli kurban and sechsundzwanzig .
fünfzehn years ago , i was in my mother and my brother from china to germany .
i 'm talking about this flucht möcht .
but it 's mostly about me to do about these people who have this kind of ermöglicht and they 've done a success story .
but first of all , i 'm going to tell you where that is that .
i am uigurin .
uiguren are a little volksminderheit that lives in the forest of china .
and this region is called by the chinese gebiet xinjian .
it 's about fünftausendsechshundert miles of germany away .
in china , 10 million uiguren of aber in the region is the largest uigurische community outside china .
and this uiguren life so that we have to have ständigen leiden .
hundreds of thousands of wurden have been able to grow up to uigurien families in our own home as a minderheit .
our mother , , , was verdrängt out of education .
in schools and in cities , only a child will still have chinesisch .
and we think of our technology , not just frei .
so the uiguren are their way to lose their culture .
and if someone 's got to get up and get up to the bottom of the uiguren 's almost long lange or death .
that was the reason why my parents asked me to fliehen children with children .
this was neunzehnhundertneunundneunzig , and i was about 11 years old .
this is a picture of vor flucht .
we did n't have enough money , so i had to get my father first .
i erinner myself a lot of people who have helped us in the flucht .
i was ' to many of them .
but i 'm just going to go to the mischa first unseren unseren .
i 'm going to put it in my moment when i look at my eyes .
he was great , 'ne in , , and we did , and he took him back with his little lada on a . .
the first one was übergeben .
i know that many of a major image of schleppern have already that those only have done a lot that they want to have to be flüchtlinge , and they 're not interested in schicksale .
but i 'm going to say `` würd '' to call me as a als , not as schlepper .
because mischa has mischa us .
he was in the flughafen in bischkek on a aussichtsbrücke , and she was finally letzten to the last point , whether we were really sure of the kamen .
in fact , we came up , and we were there , and i know the mother of my kind of thought that i was n't going to go out of the raus .
it 's not about you .
we go out .
because i had a look at my hand , and there was a single name , and there was a fremder name , but there was a fremder name .
i had to go to firusa as a firusa .
and i ' myself to the zollbeamten of der , and he was mich me , he had my look into the hand .
silence .
schweiß .
a long way .
we finally got durchgewunken .
in münchen , i was in helfer , a lot of years , that we 've made a lot of this .
i erinner myself to the an woman who used to have been mit to us .
in a flüchtlingsheim mit , four families per dreizehn familien .
at least vierzig children .
a gemeinschaftsbad and a küche .
there was king faces .
and a lot of different languages .
and we did n't have any privacy .
my mom , my brother , and i had to share a zwölf-quadratmeter-zimmer .
there was getting sick and tears and homework .
friends were n't going to be besuch , because i 'm what we wohnten .
just my klassenleiterin of the übergangsklasse in the bescheid hauptschule knew that i was .
she knew my story , and she was me , and she had to me .
for example , she got me to rhythmische me what i do n't do .
but they also kind of like , deutsche .
i spent my whole pubertät in asylbewerberheim .
this was not just my mom .
alone , with children , without their husband , and in the unsicherheit , we just because we had a duldung and jederzeit jederzeit jederzeit .
i said , `` well , i 'm very aggressiv . i was very aggressiv .
it 's also a little bit of fun to tell you here , but i 'm just to be thinking about my story .
i was very aggressiv , and i was really interested in my school .
the first thing that came to katholische was katholische katholische , where we first had some children with the kids .
with normal , i would say , i would have kids who had to do something in a asylbewerberheim .
i also am ' to the caritas-mitarbeiterinnen who mich me and my brother and ausflügen meinen .
only we just bisschen .
i 'm also talking about a few mitarbeiterinnen die that has done with us on our own life , because our parents have not heard .
or you just have just gemalt .
we are always very sehr .
i know that we know of the zaun , the vor , to the people , because some of them were fremde people for us , and that 's why it was important .
after two years , my father came to germany .
the problem was , it was right away from bayern to niedersachsen , because it was n't going to be a place where it was angeblich .
i erinner in a very high sehr , very engagierte anwältin die , who did it , to come back to his father before china , and even she would have been able to live in münchen 's lives .
and i ' myself , at the time , that i was very happy , very , six months ago , that we finally had to go into a normal neighborhood .
we got a aufenthaltsgenehmigung aufenthaltsgenehmigung for three years , and we had finally had a own wohnung with a little bit of a eigenen and a eigenen .
and i actually had a room .
it was very small , and i did n't have a schreibtisch in it , but it did good , but i was good , i could take my door .
and i 'm sorry to tell you the time that i 've never been doing it , but i have to leave the hauptschule without a abschluss .
i did n't really have to look for myself .
there was a ehrenamtliche kam that has always unterstützt me on the way , and it still does n't understand the idea that i can get to the second bildungsweg of my second bildungsweg .
and then they started to quali the quali .
i thank the very first thing that i felt believed , and i really did n't really have the only time that i was able to get it back to the middle .
and then i went to imal .
and before i got to imal , i was in the best friend of my best friend straßenfußball straßenfußball .
bunt-kickt-gut is a organization or a new project of organisierten .
but i was no longer a fußballerin hab , but i was just because i did n't have any place where we could just get to a place where we could just go .
we had a ventil system , which we used to unsere our aggressionen .
and the leiter of bunt-kickt-gut half us to feel that we could tell our problems , and we unterstützte ourselves , and we could somehow irgendwie ourselves in the questions .
and then i came up to imal , international-munich-art-lab .
and this is a project where young people without a abschluss , they have to get a chance to get sich .
this really made a very good job , and i 've got to make art , i think , art is something i 'm doing .
through bunt-kickt-gut and the link to bunt-kickt-gut , a filmemacher .
he made the film `` über '' about my friends and me .
and the movie won lots of preise .
we realized that people were interested in our history .
he was a very special sense , because we 've never seen that people have heard us .
and that was a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to rumhängen anymore .
i want to make anything out of my life .
a mitarbeiterin of refugio , a beratungsstelle for me , came to my idea of a jugendgruppe of den münchener .
but since i was in the fetten building , i was doing it in a casting for a year , and the title is fluchten to one .
so i was right .
i played .
and the great thing is , after one , two redakteure of vom from auf are auf to me .
and i was asked to say , i 've got to be a little bit of a radiobeiträge .
i thought , `` well , great . jackpot .
yeah , i 'm sorry .
and i made it for the das radioprogramm , and jetzt radiobeiträge puls , and one of my favorite over the theaterstück win-place-show , where i was mitspielte as a für for the european civis-medienpreis .
and i actually did it .
now , i 'm working on the hochschule for für and film münchen dokumentarfilmregie in the third year , and i 'm stipendiatin stipendiatin .
and this was something that i would not have been able to do with any of any time or not like any or any of the form of refugio or projects like this could be done for me .
they 've been told me that i 've open spaces , and i 've shown them that i 've been looking at how i can be erkämpfen in the way .
and that 's where i 'm going to come to you .
every one of them has a chance to help people like to have a second chance and find their lives or their place .
because the people who live here are zirka flüchtlinge , and each of them are full of hope , and every one of them has a huge potential .
they have made a lot of entschlossenheit with a lot of hürden hinter .
and with this , you might be really a profit of germany and for every single one .
and i could actually do a lot of things you can do , but i 'm not going to have any time time , even though i have a minute fünfzig , i have you give you a qr-code .
now you 're going to be your cell phone , you can not tell me that you can not have a code .
put the code code , and then you come up with the side of bunt-kickt-gut with lots of good things you can do .
and that would make us very well .
now , i 'm going to take it for a personal job , and we 'll see every morning .
and check that code .
i 'm going to call it .
a lot of the cell do n't have a gar .
is you got brav , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
00 ja .
just a einen gruß gruß .
i 'm sorry that we have chosen .
my name is robin .
my künstlername is slightly easier than it 's sich .
i come out of it , i 've come up with , which is where it is .
but i 'm also very fortunate to be able to be heute in heute , but it 's really beautiful here .
i 'm going to hear all of this every single time .
and this is not a surprise . that 's a feeling .
yes , yes , in the other speakern , i 'm not here today to go here to belehren you .
i do n't know what .
but it 's me that i write a paper on my hand , and then it comes down with a little bit of time , mostly at poetry slams , or even as events as the eben .
yes , and i 've been asked to give you a couple of text here , which is to make the whole thing a little bit .
and that 's exactly what i 'm doing here .
yes .
i start with a joke .

so , the one is , in english , i 'm not two englische you you , and i 'm not sure , but i 've never been hannes , but i 've been you , but i 've always felt very funny , i 've always lustig you
say the other mistake .
now , me he n't .
this is where we used to be in the niveau .
the first text is a little liebesgedicht that i wrote .
i did n't know it at one of these things that was made of me .
it 's called the title .
and yes , she did n't understand it .
when my head was in my coma , i was schlief my hands on the top .
my leg was even under my ceiling , my leg , the outside my ceiling .
my leg was spent through the ceiling .
it 's about her head , it 's on my left , and the rest of her feet , the leg , the leg , with the outside , the outside outside its leg outside the ceiling .
this has ausgeschaut ausgeschaut , when you 're going to do it 's going to be my leg .
it was very scary .
and the next thing i did was i was a very first person who was very much for me .
and that 's why my zwar .
we have n't yet have a kontakt anymore .
my geisteskranker mandela was from my metzger metzger .
already as a child has opened up with liebe .
i 'm just like that . yes .
yes , odd is short .
it 's not going to be done .
jesus is the only `` steht '' on the scheibe of scheibe .
but where was finally , when he told me about retten sticker ?

close text .
the next text is a little longer .
he 's actually going to take a second .
so writing .

is the beginning of a novel , the one that i 'm going to talk about in ich-form .
ah , it 's about 'nen typen guys , so it 's a von guy who abenteuer the hair and make a little bit .
but i 'm going to ' myself back to this point of view of the literarischen .
because i do n't put the hair out of my hair .

if i get kiffe , i 'm going to get empty .
so , as a piece of the piece , he 's trying to do that .
yes , i 'm not going to get out .
very good for a second .
the next text is also a little sprachspiel .
most people do n't understand .
i 'm also sorry .
and that 's where you do , i like to be with your own and with my language language .
i 've always liked to feel with me .
and yes , they come out of things like this .
it 's called the title .
it 's a little strange thing .
it 's probably the epischissendste sprachspiel sprachspiel that i ever wrote .
we can also be able to do that .
yes , we are dosen .
let 's take all of this .
we weltraumdosen .
but me down .
but i can .
i 'm going to be ashamed .
i do n't speak .

no idea .
yes , klatscht klatscht me .
i always am telling you , you know , not .
the next piece of the auch also is to start with text .
it 's kind of a little sprachspiel sprachspiel .
i wrote the way back to insects .
very clever .
yes , again , text is short .
it 's a little mitmachtext .
and that 's pretty cool to me , and i think that you 're going to go to three and three drei .
my text is the title , all good things are cool .
so our skin is trocken .
we we we .
so streicheln , they have to be , , rei , chel and kratzen , and then that 's all better and better , and that 's it .
and pretty close the moment .
yes , noch 'n 'n . that 's one thing .
and that 's pretty much fun , when i do so , i think that we can make all of these so , , so we can try all of that .
right , so , what the hell does n't do .
the text is the name , and this is what it is .
yes .
doing fun with you .
it 's text just a little bit like this .
i like to say , tiny kleine .
this is a verstecktes sexuelles wortspiel .
sexuelles is written with scharfem ' .
scharfes s ?
yes , yes .
it 's fun .
yes , there 's a satz .
it 's written in querformat .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's kind of impossible to put satzzeichen satzzeichen into it , which is the point .
here , another text .
this is a scheißtag day .
is the title of text .
this day is a scheißtag , and he knows it .
he already knew it before i got him .
he took me on a short time , and he would then anschließend me .
i could still get into my suhlen later .
i made him the joy .
it was scheißtag to allen the rest of every day , and i gelegt the sleep .
with a schelmischen grinsen in the face of anything else ?
and intent , not to give him an würdigen , by indem .
and i would still go back to the end again , i can not be able to gehandelt it .
there is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what was einstein 's telling when he was n't his steak ?
i q .
this is how it works .
letter buchstabe sounds like the cow .
that 's funny .
yes , the next text also learned the paper .
it 's more powerful .
so , i do n't just know anything .
i 'm also very interested in the same way .
and that 's what i 'm asking to be when i 'm a herkomm .
and , yes , i 've just wrote this text here .
he 's wearing the title .
my father came from wien , and came to me and i made out of her .
yes .
if we have to do it .
thank you for the sound .
yes , in that würd , i like to make a little advertising .
i ca n't give you any visitenkarten or so much , i have to do this forever .
and that 's kind of like me , and i 'm able to make myself a und and a ich veranstalte .
you can like to show it .
and yes , i 'm going to be moderier , i 'm actually ' in .
and , yes .
this is what i 'd like to say .
it 's on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertising that i wrote wrote .
weighs .
rich to vitamin c .
so the zehe .
vitamin zeh .
and that 's funny .
i wish i 'd like to talk about the friend of your friend , but the pointe was just einfach .
yes , it 's not quite a beliebtester .
if you you to stop the gärungsprozess of you you to to the .
yeah .
thank you for listening .
you 've got great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me start with a ketzerischen question .
why do n't you even altersforschung ?
i think everybody who had to verbraucht the question to ask whether he was going to be potentiell the idea of the situation .
and the answer is clear .
we now know that life might be the only fünfundzwanzig point of genetisch percent .
it 's got to have some umwelteinflüsse , ernährungsregimes geben have <S> the auf .
but why do we know so much ?
why is we going to bombardiert bombardiert 's nachrichten news die ernährungsbereich dem ?
they remember alle fünfzehn years ago .
it was fat .
you thought , if you were fett out of food , you 're going to get fett out of food , you 're all going to be gesund and get older .
what zur zur zur regalen regalen was in low-fat-produkten in , and what has happened to have is that each year has become dicker .
then you say , ah , no .
but it did n't get the fat .
they 're the kohlenhydrate .
and then what happened to be like the paleo-diet of the low-carb-diet , the atkins-diet , and so forth .
so it 's always going to go back to new and new 'ne sau .
where are the verirrungen verirrungen ?
now , the reason for this is for me to tell you , is that , for example , dass durch ansätze durch ansätze zu ansätze into scientific weisheiten .
so , for example , for example , a einzelfall is einzelfall .
you know , you know , they all know .
neunzehnhundertachtundsechzig veröffentlichte a lot of gelesene magazine a new rubrik .
the top ten of the todeskandidaten todeskandidaten for the year .
keith richards was on a eins for seven years .
then the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean calmet .
the oldest person who has ever on earth is alive .
hundertzweiundzwanzig years ago .
i know there are people there , who say that they 're sechshundert , but they ca n't even have their geburtsurkunde yet .
jean calmet is becoming hundertzweiundzwanzig .
and she heard mit with hundertsiebzehn rauchen , but hundertachtzehn hundertachtzehn , and finally hundertachtzehn with hundertzwanzig vollends dem the path of gravity , and then stop smoking .
with hundertzweiundzwanzig , they 're dead .
what does that tell us ?
no , you know , healthy .
but it tells us that adults is very complicated , and that we have a few statistics , we need to have a experimentelle , and we have to ask simple questions .
but the only question of the simple simple thing about this very simple sachverhalt , that 's women who are women who are young and older than men .
what is that ?
we now know it .
so that 's when we 're going to testosteron the testosteron , which is what 's called in the nebenhoden community .
and there are 'nen all kinds of evidence that are men in men , and they 're women .
now , you can imagine each for yourself as though this is anti-aging-weg .
österreich is a freies country .
but there 's still more tipps , no fear .
we have to be hüten to verwechseln hüten .
sounds complicated , but it 's easy to do with üblichen fragetechniken .
so , here 's where besucht 'ne hundertjährige oma and ask , why do you get out of something like this , you 've got so much different from it ?
ah .
oma has zehn every day from every day .
that 's probably the secret of your age , right ?
the ten states , maybe not only zigaretten .
or they 're geschadet geschadet , and the würde are getting older , and they 're older , and they 're older even older .
even difficult statistics are not always aussagekräftig .
for example , for example , 'ne 'ne sehr , very clearly , the idea that people who are töpferkurse in älter are older than people who do n't do it .
einwandfrei .
it 's reproduzierbar .
is that an tonerde ?
no .
it 's because people have just got money money in the pocket to make their age and the erkrankungen disease .
but if i have to give a group of labortieren to get food , and if you can get the average number of death , if you 're going to be the average number of zwanzig , you 're not going to have a , , but it 's
and they were actually made to do that .
you have to tell me , the ist is very zerstritten , but even i 'm hoping to be the feinden of my life is that regelmäßiges fasten fasten das life .
and that works for the entire organisms .
for example , bacteria do .
you can see 'ne of bacteria here .
if we look at the fasten , in the gestrichelten line , we see the number longer .
the same is true for hefen , würmern fliegen , and it 's been only only two years ago in the united states that it 's actually für for monkeys .
it 's not about being dünn .
it 's also working with liebhabern der .
and this is another experiment that was made in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you 've got 'ne mausgruppe , and it 's a hat of verabreicht verabreicht , a diät diet , where you have so many käsestücke here and day and night .
and the wundert of it , both of them , is also dick , dick and haben 'ne ganz schlimme .
now , you 've got 'ne parallele 's die , and it 's exactly the same amount of käsestücke that only dass zwischendurch .
they do n't have any food to have their kids to do that much .
and this mausgruppe is ist and gesund and it does n't have any fettleber .
although , both of them were mäuse beide .
they 've made a lot of them .
and they were sick and the other healthy .
so what 's going on here ?
it 's going to be a process called zelluläre selbstreinigung or autophagie angeschaltet .
when you make organisms and the food that you find , you find the way of the organismus to be bestandteile bestandteile in the cell or the bestandteile and make the abzubauen to make it possible .
that makes sense .
and this looks like .
you can see , as the cell is regelrecht regelrecht , in hauptsächlich , schrott schrott , the während of the age .
the fusioniert , where the bestandteile are bestandteile , and the cell will als the und and the der .
and so they 're going to be gehalten in the age of the alter .
this is actually the korrelat korrelat of the katharsis , or the seelenreinigung of fastende often often .
so , in fact , es regelmäßiges verlängert lives live in common organisms .
and it 's probably to imagine that it 's working on people .
and we learn that what they did n't do was not just like a little jedes on the day with two portiönchen .
no .
but , you know , when you have hunger , you know , you 're going to go , you know , maybe that 's going to be the autophagie angeschaltet .
so you 're going to begrüßen your hunger like a friend .
and that is also a sense of a sense of sense .
while neunundneunzig was nine nine percent of the human history , what was it doing ?
right , he went down .
we go back to the kühlschrank jagen when we 're hungry .
and that 's safe to biology .
now we know , we know , and that 's already in the bible , in matthäus , vers vers , the spirit is willig , but the meat is weak .
and it looks really looks like this .
this is from jan brueghel in a mittelalterlichen garden .
the three kerlen here is good , the essen of the whole day , and they eat .
and that 's kind of the eigentliche eigentliche .
so we 've been looking at the search for looking at the die of the molekulare antwort of the fastens anschalten of the organism .
this could be interesting for people that would n't be ausreicht enough to eben fastenpausen .
and it might help us to einer the one of the world 's wegkreuzungen of life .
so the question is , we can be able to fasten-antwort the die , the autophagie , the zellulären selbstverdau , if you eat it ?
and we have a lot of a bunch of hundred , which we have in the substanzen of a thousand substanzen , natural protein .
we 've made a figure that actually made this .
spermidin is a serious , the die of all of all of the life , but it also weniger into all of these organisms as much as . .
it 's on the skin .
dreißigjährige people have already deutlich less spermidin in the skin .
and if we give spermidin to people of the cells , for example , you see .
this is 'ne humane cell .
is the zellkörper , , which is the zellkern wir that we 're going to put in , and we see a lot of a little bit of this cell in the cell cell , and the entstehen of the alters , the . .
gefastete cells would look like that .
and that works in every common organisms .
here , for example , here is an example .
so we have found substanz substanz the molekulare molekulare .
life is also a lot of longer in common .
and the answer is that again , you can see typische überlebenskurve überlebenskurve überlebenskurve of . .
they 're simple drosophila-fruchtfliegen .
after four days , all the dead are dead , and half days is probably dead .
when we get spermidin into water , it 's going to be used to grow and better .
we also know that human beings , that we have von spendern , in culture , about three times , are about three times as long as we have them .
and the forschungen also legen me that the life of all the mäusen are ganzen through spermidin .
and not only is just life , it 's the gesundheitsspanne .
these muslims are mäuse .
so .
now , of course you all know that , where 's spermidin spermidin ?
as the name is , it 's got discovered in the ear , it 's coming into a very high konzentrationen rate .
but i can trösten them , even in weizenkeimen frischem 's pfeffer pfeffer , and a product of fermentierten sojabohnen , which is japan in large major , , which is so nattou nattou is a lot of spermidin .
and we said , `` well , do we get spermidin to alterungsprozesse , if we do n't do it , and then it might make a better aufräumt to it ?
because you have to know that the common nenner of all these disorders of diseases is because of the age of proteinschrott in the brain .
and we did it done in some experiments .
you might be wondering , we 've done the fruchtfliegen .
it 's also going to be fruchtfliegen , if you 're old .
they have more proteinschrott in the brain when they 're old .
and the molekularen mechanismen that are zuständig in memory is very similar to people .
now , why do you ask the person to see the die 's erinnerung memory ?
this is what experiment is in gemeinsam with us stefan stefan of berlin .
they take a fruchtfliegen fruchtfliegen , and there 's a geben that 's going to have a duft that you love .
zwetschge .
and let 's look at this zwetschgenduft aalen .
and take the same same way , give them back in the kammer , give them back to another duft of den you love , and you give them some other duft that you love , which is kirsch .
we 're going to make it as a while , but they sie the während , as they were 'ne 'ne .
klassischer klassischer .
you take the same again , the same ones , in the same .
you go down to the grad down here , and you see that .
and if you 're in there , they give them off the side of the side , and they 're looking at the other side .
where do they go ?
yeah .
zur .
except for two .
these are the depperten .
or , say , they have some character .
i love my zwetschge , and i do n't want to go through my so belohnung .
okay .
but it 's kind of a 'ne form of the zunimmt that 's used with the age .
not only is fly .
and we actually could use the erinnerungsfähigkeit of the fliegen through spermidin-fütterung on a auf , auf a niveau , niveau again .
and the proteinaggregate who came in the brain were back .
it 's called spermidin , not just as alterung , but sondern , erkrankungen , eventuell .
and that 's important because we want to want to die the lebensspanne of the se .
it does n't make sense that the time of verlängern .
and i do n't want to leave you to do that you can not be able to give you a very simple force , we 'll have to be able to make sure that we should be dead .
even more noch fasten .
it 's not that you get weight or so .
in fact , by the way , there 's a group of österreich group of people who are doing a day and a day every day .
this is the so zehn-in-zwei-community under the leitung of bernhard ludwig and erwin haas .
and that 's very good about this .
that means , it 's praktikabel .
it 's vermeiden .
it does n't seem to be complex at all , at least , it 's not very good at all .
it 's really about you .
you know , mittlerweile mittlerweile is hinreichend to diabetes diabetes , even if they 're schlank .
and you also know that it can fly that growth growth can grow from tumors .
this is 'ne 'ne , and sehen die .
for 30 days , these are all dead .
it 's very geringe of the same dosen .
to create a progeriatrischen effect .
there 's only one example , this is working in almost every organisms .
eat the local and vegetables .
it was vermeiden to the von of vitamintabletten , or von .
you know now that vitamin-a can be -- -- and vitamin-e-supplementationen cancer cancer .
it does n't matter in vitamin and vitamin d .
we 're a lot of the ' of the ein , because a denn , because of vitamin d in the skin .
some of them are at least three of a time every week of a week , and that 's trivial .
zigaretten of anfänglichen , beispiele kosten per million percent of fünfzehn every year .
do n't even do that 's time in time .
the impact of happiness and blutdruck on the life is belegt .
because haiti 's almost almost as long as women .
alkoholtrinker , moderate alkoholtrinker , live longer than nichttrinker .
weintrinker live longer than biertrinker .
but biertrinker lives still longer than nichttrinker .
only schnapstrinker is dying as a result .
what 's this ?
the people who does that have to do with a irgendwelchen .
no way , no way that it is easy .
now , here 's a fettfleck at the window , and then i 'm am with the windows of 'ner alkoholhaltigen .
and what 's probably happened in your gefäßsystem .
fettartige ablagerungen , cholesterinplagues , and what is , rather than alkohol , without da .
that 's why alkohol wirkung alkohol .
you know , partners , you know , have a professional partner with oder , or 'ne 'ne , with your assoziiert family .
you should n't live in a much straße road .
now , you 're looking at it in the same way .
but it does n't do anything with feinstaub .
it 's about lärmbelastung .
you can measure the way you 've ever been able to get a befahrenen straße , and a lot of it is wohnt , and it 's more hat .
and that 's what he says , `` i 'm going to be eh . ''
i can do all of you and i do n't sound sound .
right ?
he still has more mehr in the blood , and that 's bad .
the oil should be limitiert because of course .
we now know that knoblauch have actually metabolische metabolische .
it 's because it 's the den rate .
and we also know that zwiebeln and knoblauch are mäuse against infektionskrankheiten .
and the one of the things that we 've been doing is that our großmütter our großmütter has been schon to us , and zwiebelsud , and weiter .
it does n't matter .
several studies show that dark chocolate can be schokolade with gegen .
in the summer , a recent study was rausgekommen that showed that this was 'ne by schokolade the tafel of a schokolade chocolate a day of the sechzigjährigen of a sechzigjährigen .
in fact , this is a little bit more fun to be here , but it 's dünner .
there are studies that show this : there are studies that do n't show it .
what 's clear is that kaffee is wirkt gegen , and wirkt the ihre of the verbessert .
and coffee , of course , is a good fastenhelfer , because it 's autophagie autophagie , as we could put together with guido kroemer of paris .
'ne 'ne and schöne and studie spent over the years of thousands of people have been taken over the years that showed us that every people who have handvoll every handvoll are their essen zwanzig .
this is a huge value for 'ne epidemologische research .
and that 's for mandeln , paranüsse , pistazien , haselnüsse , macadamia , pinienkerne , pinienkerne .
but it 's not the erdnüsse to erdnüsse botanisch .
the only thing they 're going to do is they 're going to be indem by , nüsse , okay ?
but these are actually bohnen .
so for example , it 's not about the erdnüsse .
the next point is a little bit more heikel .
it 's going to aufnahme the aufnahme of a physical organism , so meat and milchprodukten , but only when you 're between fünfundvierzig and fünfundsechzig .
'ne of beautiful study shows that she 's when they 're in into a lot of proteins , they get their krebrisiko so much more than than they have a strong .
that 's not the time you get the tierische that you have to find and proteine that you do n't think of heranwachsende children , or the ones that you have to grow , and it 's not just to say you want to hear it .
they 're mostly vermeiden .
whatever you do is , you know , geschmeidig the best thing that you know is the nietzsche who 's seitensprung , the gesagt , the , , the fröhliche , the fröhliche , the anzeichen are the anzeichen of the health of the gesundheit .
everything 's gehört is unbedingte .
this is the gentleman salvatore herr who has ever been talking about this for a year , hundertacht er .
he comes from from my home aus dem , never never sick .
and it goes very good .
it 's not a paradigmatischer einzelfall , but he does n't have a anekdote but he lives live in a hotspot , where there is a lot of healthy hundertjährige .
it 's about the ernährungsvorschriften gefolgt that i told you today .
we should think of all the bei of all these geschilderten experiments .
now , the hauptproblem of the alterns mir did n't make me an biologisches , but it could be a gesellschaftliches .
you traut the old people , less and could be one of the fatalsten fehler of culture .
dostojewsky wrote the biggest foundation of a year to death death .
the brüder karamasow .
a work , in zeitgenössische , allem , zeitgenössische jugendliche .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm looking at you .
a question is , no one , who needs to stand up , because that 's a little bit of nämlich who 's got to you ?
ausbeute is very low .
geringer still when i thought .
but it 's probably the reasons you do n't think about it , but the people who are die this is actually durchaus .
lots of people alleinsein and einsamkeit and einsamkeit and synonyme .
that 's not the case at the time .
you see , i 'm going to be einsamkeit , and it 's actually more likely to be a sort of human being than alone .
maybe it 's also not that they 're not talking about it because the question is formuliert .
is you feel einsam or is you einsam ?
you can feel einsam with yourself .
and you can be einsam without feeling at the moment .
it 's also a lot of scham that does n't have to deal with .
this is going to be a little bit more here now to einsamkeit .
in addition , it 's scham and scham is in kibera .
it takes time .
and so nobody 's going to have to have come to some of the two seconds i 've given you .
it requires einsamkeit .
so , for example , it takes time to become aware of their own .
and we also need some practice to be able to talk about it .
and we do n't have to make that mistakes .
we do n't have the language to have the language to have the für to us , even though we 're einsam ?
there are two grundhaltungen to the two that i 'm going to go through .
the one part of humanity , you know , you know , you know , you know , . .
the birth to death is actually just a einsam .
there are few moments in life where you can kann the überdecken .
these people are often going to get too often and und the rest of the day .
i do n't have time , so it 's not your lieblingsmantra .
and then there are people who are not less likely to say , things are connected with everything .
i do n't actually know that , well , i 'm just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the big group , which i 'm even gehöre around as well .
so remember , okay , today , i 'm einsam and i 've been einsam , and the next day , it 's always all together .
if we think about blogs , we always think of the great einsamkeit .
the einsamkeit of the , , the einsamkeit of the advice , on the edge of a kranken .
but about this einsamkeiten , which is my großen , i 'm not going to talk about , but i want to talk about the little , about the einsamkeiten einsamkeiten , where we can tell you a kind of a theater
i do n't want to talk about last and wonnen of the alleinseins .
on the other hand , there is n't enough to worry about us to festzustellen .
the fotografin christine schneider in front of us will have some of these photographs that i want to show you .
it 's why we 're always trying to look at each other .
we do n't all know that if people were really comfortable in this moment .
but who do n't know the moment in particular event where you think of all of you who share with each other , only one thing that is lost in the corner , and has never given to the zum .
and all of these einsamkeit einsamkeit , i 'm sure everybody here .
maybe some of you have seen that today .
what you 're going to do is that you 're going to put it in the cell phone , often , as well as a very , very , very likely to look at the same time , the das , the auf , the rumdaddeln auf on the
clearly , if you look at the screen .
we do n't do here now .
yes , so , there 's the einsamkeit , which is , in the distance , from the point , that 's one of the redners sitzt of a bühne number of erwartungsvollen faces , and you get a little bit to hope that you do n't forget your
these are the einsamkeiten einsamkeiten that you see from the outside .
we 're going to leuten people .
but i 'm sure , there are also people in the room who are von in the feeling that they 've spent their own life , as they 've been doing , you know , they 're einsamkeit , , with themselves .
and there is also a lot of people in this room , and it 's been the name of it , because they 're talking to people who is to be tod to people , because it 's a . .
there 's nothing that there 's nothing that there 's many people as well as people who are connected to people around you .
and there are people who have evolved to themselves even though they get more and more und .
i 'm going to do the digital einsamkeit .
and setz ' her .
the analoge is the most einsamkeit .
these are people who are nach after their happiness .
that 's always relatively .
there is no offizielle number , no vorgegebene number when someone has enough money , when not .
we 're fällt around the old people .
it 's the analoge form of einsamkeit .
but in fact , every year in the life that we 've been able to share with großstädte , many people , with facebook or facebook , or facebook , is digital digital .
you can be connected to hundreds of hundreds of people without having a single person to be able to do with them .
it 's more like the quantität of human relations , which is missing at the digital level of the relationships .
the two forms of the einsamkeit are often very gegeneinander .
it 's also that the analoge einsamkeit is a little bisschen muffig .
whereas the digital einsamkeit is good for für and kolumnen in lifestyle-magazinen .
it 's the auszugehen of the digital system that is going to get more efficient in the future , if the opportunities to create , to become bigger .
i do n't know if you 're going to have this sense of being a little bit of this , that we 're pretty similar to the east , where we 're going to be einsamkeit .
or whether you find a new term then .
but these are also the problems of the nachfolgenden generation .
almost even bigger , even of the self itself , the fear of the einsamkeit and of fear fear is the number of things that are a lot to do .
dalida , the great schlagersängerin , a very human person has written a wonderful chanson of um-nicht-allein-zu-sein .
in fact , you know what people are doing to do n't alone .
they build kathedralen ; they live children that will be einsam and alone alone .
but that allerbanalste did n't stop her to stop the einsamkeit of the einsamkeit of money .
shoppen go .
things erwerben .
both of the process , the way , because it 's at least a kontakt , because it 's at least a sense of herstellt as the objects that you have in .
the problem is that it 's very quick at this point , and this is the very gegen of this talk against the einsamkeit .
that 's why we need to find new things in the way .
i have a werbung for an werbung unterhosen .
and the werbten ganz sich werbten of the kommunikation of handy with the slogan of be .
what we have to do with unterhosen is that they do n't know , but they do it as well .
so , einsamkeit has nothing to do with the alleinsein of life , where people do n't have to do it .
erich kästner has written a poem , and there is a vers , and at the end , the worst is einsamkeit .
hand on your heart , who knows that ?
in a relationship of aufzuwachen or the other way to look at the andere and die the other and zähneputzen suddenly , just plötzlich themselves , to make a einsam and feel questions , who is this person in ?
am i doing the same thing ?
a study said that the einsamsten women of the women , married , with children , feeling . .
now , weil , i do n't know anymore , i do n't know the fact i have learned the way i 've ever learned .
but there 's also no matter because there are n't at least many studies at least at the time , and the reaction is always the best thing that people get in front of me .
that 's what it 's like all of this is , of course , almost a banalität .
now , zweit einsamkeit is all geläufig , and yet , we 're not talking about it .
talk about just about little things on the party .
that 's probably what happened in every single case .
now , as you can see , even though you 've got to think of yourself , what do i do here ?
who is this person in my bed ?
also , there 's a kind of a die that does n't necessarily have to do what 's needs to do with the quality of the sexuellen .
there 's not enough to do with the quality of relationship .
it 's always always been there .
we do n't talk about them because we do n't look at it .
we 're just not talking about it in the world .
in the business , the conversation is also the präsenter as we have .
i was unlängst unlängst at so so , and i see a group of five anzugträgern , better , three of my two and two trugen .
the two men have spent , the two women who have women in the kostüm have been unterhalten .
and between then , a little bit more , a little bit of a , , something called mit with the mit in the hand .
i glaub , i do n't have to do that in the middle of this place , and that is where you have been able to experience in the future .
it 's the einsamkeit of the . .
but it is also the einsamkeit of the berufswechsels .
we all know the anzugträger or i know , and i 'll have some of you guys in the same way that i 've seen you .
in flughafenlobbys , in konferenzsälen , in hotels , the bars are not wissen often who you are not aware of what they 're doing .
where they are , where they left .
and this is a form of über that is n't talking about .
it 's also just as erklärlich as it can be missbraucht to be als .
stichwort is up here .
i once told a unternehmensberater that he was called angerufen by one who , and said that , because it 's entsetzliches , you ca n't imagine .
a vorstandskollege was just in the kantine .
so he damit himself to abschuss .
and two months later , he was zurückgetreten .
it 's just about the end of the einsamkeit itself .
it 's always being connected with emotion .
she has a little und , and she has acromegaly .
we have the idea that we do .
fear , trauer of anger , anger and . .
but we should also forget the arts .
the freedom that the stolz are stolz the sehnsucht .
so my appell is looking at the schauen .
come on , and life is ebbe and flut .
let them go , and do n't get rid of them .
because there is still a lot worse than this is and it 's a vielleicht , and it 's leere when you 're still out there 's a einsamkeit .
now , it 's part of life .
since i 've been working on the way that i 've been talking about two things .
one of my favorite things i did n't know about my regiere was a diktator , but i realized i was going to get out there , and i would n't have angerufen the idea why i thought i 'd been verliere , maybe i 'd like to .
i 've been able to get it since i 've been given the einsamkeit in my life , and people have come to come and come .
this is exactly how the bekanntschaften that you do .
and i 've become a da .
people come and go to the way they 're not sie to themselves , whether a begegnung can become a freundschaft or a partnerschaft .
when i was a kid , i was incredibly peinlich .
they ca n't come up to any gartenzaun vorbeigehen without someone who lead to a conversation .
whether it 's in the oder or the economy .
every time it was endlosen to speak .
as a child , i found out how to invent .
so , as a result , i have to make sure that beneidet beneidet to make this openness .
but only since i was thinking about myself , i had a einsamkeit , and it was at the moment , and i would still be able to open it up .
you can feel einsam 's hard to make your best auftritt .
thank you .
yeah , thank you very much .
i 've got some of them here .
a fünfhunderteuroschein is a zweihunderteuroschein and a einhunderteuroschein .
and now , do i tell you , if you just put together with the welchen , what would you take ?
most of them do n't want to choose .
and this is a very good idea .
and why ?
because we have a lot of that with the kids that they have .
we 're going to do that in a health .
there 's a little bit of the maßnahme that we have , because of eight , and we 're going to help it .
we decide to give up for the einhunderteuroschein of the einhunderteuroschein , and the one of the sport .
but big , big .
i 'm not very valuable to that .
or we decide to zweihunderteuroschein for the zweihunderteuroschein .
that 's for free .
but also a lot of gesundheitseffekte is still a lot of that .
so i 'm not going to be so valuable .
and i 'm going to tell you today today , with the beginning to make the biggest aufwand .
if you 're beschäftigt with violence and health , you do n't get to a part of it .
and the subject is übergewicht .
and the theme was übergewicht , it was n't a bit of a thema , it was about until the siebzigerjahre .
and then the number of übergewichtigen in germany were too strong .
and i asked myself , what was going on in the ? ?
why was this so steil of this ?
and then i did , and i was also fündig .
because it was exactly what happened in the years .
what was there ?
there was aerobic to germany .
and we 're always going to be more and more dicker ?
and i went on .
neunzehnhundertsiebenundsiebzig comes from germany .
and this is going to be übergewicht .
and in the course , the light has the kurve even on the road .
and what 's going on for germany ?
rumba and zumba and isdn and hlx and und , and how this is meant .
and we 're always going to get bigger and we 've got a lot of it ?
well , i get one and a zusammengezählt .
because it was clear .
you make a dick .
and of course , i 'm not here today , to tell you that , in a sense ,
because that 's not true .
but here we have found out here .
the flut of the flut trainings -- and it did n't have a sense of wir that we 're going to gesünder and gesünder .
so , what is it ?
you have to get it ?
and there is also a great study in the study of countries .
they also have the problem with security .
and they have taken in the neunzigerjahren low-fat-produkte .
and then they 'd like to look at night for what was actually happening here ?
and you 've seen , people are actually going to eat fat , and they 're just going to get less calories to them , and yet they get a lot .
and that was a great thing .
and so they 've called es .
so we explain this ?
and then you have to be able to look at the body as a power .
here we have so 'ne .
and on the one hand , it 's a förderband , and we 're going to do it all the kohlen , we 're going to put it all up .
and here 's energy from the electricity .
now , if we 're going to put more kohlen here , we 're going to put it into our kraftwerk , and we 're using the different side of the energy and it makes it peng .
the human body is not going to be right .
it can be energy .
and that 's a little bit of fat .
our greatest and wichtigster energiespeicher .
but what happens is , when we have less like we have , energie energy , and energy staut , then the energy will make it , only to end .
the abgabeseite community has gone .
there is no other life going on .
we 're just noch .
and that 's what happens .
our großeltern are neunzehnhundertzehn zwanzig miles per mile .
and we 're just going to start to look at a mile in two feet , and that is the positive point .
there are studies that are left from five -- five feet .
i 'm going to tell you something more plastischer with my friend .
you give me a ' of the chair ?
mike , you 're going to do it ?
mike is americans .
it 's deeply , it 's not going to talk .
and he was at this time , and he 's sitting here .
it 's this typical südstaatler cowboy-stiefel , jeans karohemd , and he has a hot-dog-light in the hand .
and mike still isst and less and less and nimmt and still ca n't even light-produkte , and yet it 's always going to get better and dicker .
why ?
it 's just a sitzt .
and i was looking at how long as a so day , and that day , i made it back to his hinten , and at the time , i made a tasche .
and that 's where he 's looking at a thousand steps .
that was the distance that was mike down , and the zurückgelegt zurückgelegt was in the front of the car to the car in the car , and a little bit of a day , and back back .
and he came to a thousand steps .
this was mike , and it was 10 minutes on his legs .
dreiundzwanzig hours , and she was 45 minutes , and she was mike .
under these conditions , disease disease .
and mike is not going to because it 's too much enough to eat , so long it 's still going to get a lot like this , and it 's not going to go away , and it 's not going to be zwangsläufig , and it 's
and first of all , the energy is how you see here in his bauchraum .
but energy is reaktionsfreudig . it 's not there .
they would come back to the blut themselves .
and also , it 's aktiv and knabbert and quiet on its gefäßen .
so the blutzucker .
so if the energy zurückstaut in the blood , the doctors are hohem at hohem and blutzuckerspiegel .
and this blutzucker , who 's knabbert , like this , da überall , all over the löcher .
and happiness is still a lot of rum , and that 's what it 's all about these little wunden and we 're talking about fettplagues or arteriosklerose .
and now , heart is herz under pressure , because now we have to add the blood through these engen gefäße , and we 're talking about skin .
and if that bluthochdruck , then , in a way that you have a fettplague , it 's peng , and it goes into the body .
and if that happens to the heart , we call the heart attack .
and if that happens in the head , we 're going to call that bill .
and even in germany , every second one , heart heart rate .
that means that , in fact , every month is a second second an of energiestau .
so , even more is not enough , it 's not enough not because it does n't make any sports , it does n't matter , it 's because it does n't move .
and if you do n't know about this , you do n't look at the wrong position .
for example , at the level of time .
i 've got more far more recently in amazon , and i 'm going to go back to amazon and kommen da .
and every book was just like a thick thick , and we would be able to put it up here , we would have had a 3,000 feet high seas .
and i saw all of these guys .
and there it is , and that 's actually important if you have more energy to get more food than you will grow it up .
and if you do less energy than you 're going to grow it , it will be thin .
this is brilliant .
but why do we need some books ?
it just makes you .
and the need is , of course , is really aber but dazu .
because why scheitert a diet has to get a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet . it does n't have a lebensstil .
so what 's what we 're doing for three weeks is now just three years ago , and then we 've got five weeks at the time we 've got to come to the struggle of the day , back to that every day , every year , to
what 's going to do for five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except for frust , and a kerbe in the selbstvertrauen that we do n't have the same thing that we have .
so , for example , they 're going to be able to do a lot of diet for any of the other things that can be able to ask and see that they 're going to be able to do it in their daily lives .
yes , no .
and when we go .
and if no , let 's just make it .
because if it does n't get to rauskommt , it 's actually zeitverschwendung .
it 's the miracle that decide whether we get sick or healthy .
it 's the bad miracle that makes us enough .
and these are the good theories that make us healthy .
and if mike in the mirror , he 's looking at the result of his daily life .
if you look at the spiegel of the mouse , it looks like there 's your täglichen gewohnheiten there .
and if mike is looking at the mirror , and it 's also true to him , he is where he 's going .
because if he 's more bad than good , he 's still in the process .
and if mike in the direction , the future of his goals can be his richtung of his dreams , his minds , he does n't have to be able to feel his entire life .
then it takes just a little bit of a bad bad .
and a propos , mike is a great example of the fact that 's probably a common animal .
joseph , for example , has been able to do change from his alltag rauszurationalisieren by using the car , every single animal uses , to aufzug .
and finally , he 's sitting around the board , and he 's got to get some of us to be able to get some krampfhaft into it .
so , he 's going to go into his pick-up , and he 's going to go out there , and the rolltreppe is , as you know , is paradox , and it 's like this ratte ratte again , and it 's like ratte ratte again ,
and my opa would have been genau like this as it was .
it was landwirt , and it did n't understand it .
the one would say , sports is n't , for people , to do .
and somehow he did .
why do n't we have to go to the night in the abends of our hands , what we have all about the was ?
in fact , we 've got two hours to spend in this case , two hours , a small arm .
but it 's much more easy to do , it 's more easy to make the movement where we 're lost .
on the day .
and that 's why i 'm going to talk to you today 's perspektivwechsel .
you may probably know the situation , you go still the same time , and then you go back to the einkaufen , and you get there , you know , there 's no room there is a platz .
and this is what you see in the programmiert 's dieser programmiert in us .
we always want to keep the kürzeste gehen .
we need to make our way to have the wege .
we plan our whole life , so we have the way we 've got the kürzesten , but we have not to go to where we 're going to be .
but in a very different way .
and so you can get around the heute today , and you can see the movement that they 're looking at like .
for example , i like to call beispielsweise .
and i 'm the only one , the high and down and down and down and down and forth and everybody else .
but if i go there , then i 'm still nutz , i 'm always for myself .
and then i 'm going to go to the point that this is because of it as close to this .
and if you go to the top line , 30 minutes of sag , you say , `` you know . ''
dreitausend steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes .
and a propos dreitausend steps , if you 're going to go back every day , every time you 're going to get back to the moment of time , that 's when you do n't hear that , you know , when i do n't know , you
it may seem pretty simple .
but as a chancenblick , as a result , as a result of the time , etabliert years ago , then we go to four komma five pounds .
we do n't have it in our bodies .
and you give me a lot of time , and i 'm going to put it up .
the americans are crazy , they 're verrückt .
this is a replikat from five pounds of fat .
i 'm in the ' .
it 's just that you can see what 's going on with these little steps .
and if that is the effect of what this is , what i 'm going to do , what happens when you actually get to live life .
and those gesundheitseffekte that they make in each of their lives today every day .
once they go to schritte steps per day , they 're almost almost all of them .
and if you like to do it and time you do it , you 're going to go to the on .
then they also have fitnesseffekte noch .
and then they 're still going faster .
but they do n't make their health anymore for free .
so you do n't make your health care away from your sense and your time .
because the most important thing we do today is every day as day .
and i 'm going to make a aktiven aktiven .
and for me , it 's more than a lebensstil , for me , it 's a das that 's made of a sense of choice and life .
because i think it 's not about what we should be doing or should .
it 's also about the way that we want to do .
and so i 'm just going to give you an idea for you .
do you just want to just do it well .
and now you know , you 're going to know .
step step .
thank you .
00 how did a leonardo so much of this has actually done this incredible , such as incredible , as much of the world with other eyes ?
and so , even though , and so , as a matter of time , what could be just about the was , which was just to be schlicht , unvorstellbar ?
how could we do that today ?
is it possible to be able to do it with start-ups ?
and how can we make the force and zuversicht for our future ?
now , how do we think about the question , what do we have in innovation ?
yeah .
technology 's scientific research , and in fact , the offizielle innovationsstrategie of the government has been called the high-tech-strategie high-tech-strategie of the government .
so , i 'm really excited about that .
that 's all great .
and we can be very proud of it , and we say that we have feldern that we have in the field of these areas that we need to get our technolgien all around the world .
that we have such as extraordinary incredible unique wealth .
but how does it look at the future ?
what are the challenges that we have to have to have to society ?
and who cares about the big bang and social challenges ?
so heut , it seems to be kind of ausgemacht .
a kind of arbeitsteilung .
so the economy is to provide the challenges that we 're doing to be in the general world , and we 're going to make it as a lot of anstrengungen that we 're going to productivity productivity and efficiency .
and the people who want to do the world is better , too organizations , and vereinen and und , and so what , after the company , we 're going to be able to get the schäden of the kapitalistischen economy .
at least , reparieren .
but who says , `` well , who is so , we know , we get so much of this as common ?
what if we could take our innovationsverständnis into 'ne social and cultural network ?
so , how innovation can make cultural innovation in the same world ?
so , how do all this really mean innovation in the same world are also social ?
so , when we uns gelänge unternehmerisches and we geschickt handeln with the solution , with great ökologischer and social challenges ?
so , what else does the whole mean in terms of the moral forces , and if it makes us a whole , a ausbalancierte development development ?
because how was it ?
both sides are all sides of what companies are doing , right ?
can we do it ?
maybe you might be able to ask yourself .
we 've also been doing that for a moment .
luckily , for example , examples are examples .
muhammad yunus has mit with his grammen-bank , with their own in in an incredibly bangladesch world for armut poverty .
and interestingly , a lot more than just a verlgeich verlgeich in terms of the government that have hilfeorganisationen hilfeorganisationen .
and he 's got zweitausendsechs as a unternehmer , and it 's got bekommen by the friedensnobelpreis überreicht .
the only one that i 'm going to get you to do is i 'm going to do with you .
gestatten , i can imagine vorstellen andré .
'n ganz young young guy .
but in fact , they 've got very ideale .
and yes , so completely total .
i like to make it completely .
and if you look at it , think about it , you think , `` well , look at what we 've got to do is we need to worry about our future .
yes , the way he 's studium , he 's going to go somewhere in the unserer hidden .
that 's what he does .
he likes his strength , and he 's very well .
and there 's something that there is in there .
so he 's not asking me , is it more that i feel like this ?
so this is the unternehmerische , he 's always going to be saying .
start-ups is in the munde .
and that 's what they like to do .
and he liked this start-up-helden .
so the right there is the wirtschaftswoche , which is , this is exactly what he did .
so it does n't know that , but it 's the idea of telling him that he 's doing .
and there was the n in the middle of the t three , and they did n't know the n .
so , the one thing that was was was surprised as the ihm of my beim was vorgestellt .
it 's got mister .
and as 'n 'n erfahrener , he turned out there .
so this is a great pleasure , and so with young people , people who work together with the experience .
and then they found it found in the dann .
and they 've lost getroffen .
so , if we were time , in fact , if we were just in the gespräche of those two years ?
yes mister mister , so , again , that 's just the same .
what 's the difference between 'nem between zwischen and zwischen and unternehmen etablierten companies ?
i have n't understood that .
yes , andré , when we go back , what 's the time , `` what 's the time , '' what does it have 'n 'n ?
so , that 's what it 's like .
technical markets , as products , cultural customers , have structures , it 's a historie .
and you can also have a very powerful thing to do that , which is the big hinbewegt .
and once 'ne 'ne schramme , even though the whole thing he can do .
so what is a start-up start-up ?
so , andré , you can see it 's a garantiert , it 's not exactly the small ausgabe of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has a very different character .
because it does n't have anything halt .
no etablierten customers , no etabliertes geschäftsmodel , nothing but it 's familiar .
and therefore , a start-up organization is an temporäre organization that 's going to end up for a business model to create a work that is , of course , but it 's mostly vor , and it 's moving .
and you 're going to realize that , of course , in this case , there 's all other ways of organisation , all other ways of führungsverständnis , all other ways .
yes , that 's me clear .
but what is we looking for what we 're looking for ?
so , i said , `` well , how about that , then , is it going to go to a better way to make a 'nen sauhaufen of money , '' right ?
so , i 'm so , there 's also , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well , well
this is called exit-strategie .
you know , your company has to erfolgreich your company , and you 've got your leben your life for your life long .
oh no .
really ausgesorgt .
so what do you mean when you start with your own money , what 's your lebensperspektive ?
so are you going to get a career as a konsumfetischist konsumfetischist or something like this ?
what happens then with your own , how do you know ?
and also , we 're looking at mal .
so , the stories on lottogewinner are not giving you an zuversichtliche perspective , because siebzig percent of the lottogewinner people have spent a lot of a finanziellen in a much more than more than a als .
money is always the result of a successful company and a good company .
yeah , money is a energiequelle for a tuns für .
and it 's the grundlage of all the wirtschaftlichen .
but it 's not the goal of a company .
yes , what 's the goal ?
the company ?
so when i get what i 'm doing , i do n't have to be able to do with my right .
and so , goals should be bestimmt to be more and so forth .
and if i did that , because i did n't know , well , how can i hear something that i do n't remember anything that i do n't know , what i do n't mean , i do n't know what i want to do ?
so that does n't make me a good feeling .
so as i 'm supposed to decide , and i 'm sorry , and it 's going to be mich , and it 's kind of vage and i 'm vage it .
yes , welcome to im .
but i 've already made a case for you .
it 's a faden .
so , that 's schon , and it 's already geheim .
successful familienunternehmen of generation to generation weitergereicht .
it 's for für .
so , how do you talk today ?
`` glaub glaub ? ''
so we 're going to keep always spirit-spicker .
bei akuten and krisen and nachhaltiger nachhaltiger .
so help .
i said , `` i can give you one of them .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister wotsu .
but there are only questions about it .
you can think that this is a moment of a very good quality of happiness .
can we take that one out of one another time that i could learn that ?
so the first one is called , i 'm going to be here , and what do i want to do ?
yeah , andré , there 's dadrum , where does it move to you about the scale that you have bigger than you are bigger ?
what do you think about the world ?
what do people do when they come together with them ?
what are you going to be ready ?
what are your code , maybe even unbewussten antriebskräfte ?
why is that important to see ?
because these are the unternehmerischen unternehmerischen .
and how did we learn from it ?
if you want to build a ship , then you do n't want to spend the men together in the morning to make it a sie of your bed holz , you teach your desire to go down the endlosen .
yes , good .
so then i went back to the next question .
what is my gewünschter zielzustand ?
what does that mean ?
yes , andré now , you 're going to darfst your goal .
bunt ausmalen in detail , but i 'm just ' in front of you if you 're dir , what you do n't want you to do it with you .
do you actually know the story about the pink ?
turn out to a degree .
not ?
ne .
so , look at the time .
do n't even have a black show .
okay ?
does it happen ?
so no black elephant .
all right ?
no big elephant .
see you ?
that 's what we 're looking at , if we 're going to focus on the way we 're not going to do .
so what is the only way ?
there 's a little bit more drüber ?
yes , clear , stell , you want to know what you want .
so quietschgelbe kannikel , or perhaps the pandas on the beiwagenmotorrad .
but stell is a bildlich .
so , by the way , i 'm just going to be magst , right ?
i 've got some of it here .
guck times if you 're the den .
clearly somebody in this room lord smith .
anyone ?
at at , three three thirty-four afternoon was was was was was blunted to to .
i want the each of the end of the me to the me that your the at the time time that .
i polishing the glass in the glass .
i was called buttering lordships scones sir , sir .
and i was plunking was 's in the potting .
constable arrest smith smith .
oh but but how you you ?
madam as as would you one not one not is not is .
her her .
it 's a it of matter a .
the real question is is observant you ?
and andré like that look like ?
did you notice ?
does anything change ?
okay .
okay , and then the one rate ,
okay .
so , let 's look at it again , as it 's time .
and action .
clearly somebody in this room 's lord lord .
anyone ?
at the precicely , three three thirty-four was was , was was was to to a a a a .
i was each each from the end of my me at , and i was thinking of at the at of the that that that .
i polishing the glass of the glas .
i was was was lordships lordships scones , sir .
and i did my the was in my potting .
constable arrest lady smith .
and andré , how about you ?
so i know , i was shocked .
i was really shocked .
as i first saw , we saw the first time .
i thought it was n't going to be true .
and more than i was going to be , when i went out to the head , it could be , i could actually be able to do that , for the area ,
through my life .
okay , okay , so i understand that makes a sense .
so to go to the verhindern , we have to sofortige the sofortige , that we have to do the worst of our imagination and our wahrnehmungsfilter .
but what 's going on here ?
what was i talking about , and what did i mean by ?
and therefore , merke you can give yourself your perception of life somewhere , is more important to the same wichtige .
well , yeah , yeah , thank you , then we 're going to go to the next question .
how could i actually get to my target ?
so , i think , `` well , good idea . ''
now , the thing i 'm going to do is , i think , is that every time i do n't know it , and i do n't really know why .
yes , andré , there 's 'ne news for you .
that 's going to be easier to you as you 've ever been . .
because if you 're clear about it , you get a innerer , your inner innerer , and if you get a ziel of your goal , you will find you , it 's going to be out of your car .
it 's almost like it is .
you 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be a way to be a brainstorming <S> in you , things in things .
that 's the famous einfälle that you 've left under the age of the age .
and yet , the question is , i 'm going to show you all the time in the moment that you 're going to go to the best who you are asking for questions to say , input more , more mehr .
and you also have a big model .
the medici have this great gekonnt .
cosimo di medici , who did n't know that more , who was asked in his palazzo in the palazzo .
so , on the left of the left , the table .
and it 's different from people .
so scientists , militärstrategen , politicians , banker , händler engineers , architects and architects and have been a very strong gepflegt .
but not in our field that is where drum is , yes , who is in charge ?
who 's right ?
but in fact , suddenly , all of these different things have been created by these sorts of things that we could have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
well , yeah , the next question is , what 's the next question , what 's the other side ?
andré , there are a unternehmer in the arts , and it 's very simple .
instead of plan big and management and so on the other step , you just have to only step down to the next step .
because what do you do to do in terms of the ungewissheit ?
but they 're going to entschlossen all of that , and they 're mit .
and if it was n't there , it was clear , dan dan takes on to make another thing .
and even if the big , bunt zielvorstellung nichts , there is still 'ne others .
and so it 's important to you to understand this .
that gives you in safety .
and on the rest of us , what do we do ?
now , yes , we did n't know , well , did n't know ?
you can say , well , you know , you know , you know , you 're also spielend .
so , spielerische spielerische , this is learning about this , and this freudvolle spielerische suchen , it 's also fun , it makes fun fun , in a company , in a company .
and that 's also , in the process , the gegen against the ungewissheit , which is always going to bange us .
yeah , thank you .
so it sounds very good .
but i do n't know , in my company , i have to know , there are lots of things that there 's going to happen .
and even for that , in india , there is always this kind of stimmung .
and i said , `` well , the politicians have to worry about this , that this is changing .
okay , my boy , come on .
so , here 's up to the water .
what do you think , how many people can change change ?
ten ?
zehntausend ?
ten million ?
look at this .
who else you see ?
exactly that .
that 's the one that you can change , you really can change it .
or to say , mahatma ghandi says to change the change that you see in the world .
think of all of a good good words and big models , but how should it work ?
there 's still a few paar paar notfalltropfen on our spirit-spicker .
it 's a lot of a lot of oder from a wenn or if you 're going to make it as if it 's a ohnmacht spürst and you all have to do it with you .
and if you look at them in this particular way , what you 're going to do is even freut your attention to you , and you can imagine that you can make a sense of being made in order to be creative .
and you can tell you what you 're looking at demjenigen , and you 're just going to talk about .
and all the end , please , please , what you actually did from the crisis , or what was bad ?
so i mean , if you 've seen it , it 's going to be gelohnt at ted .
yeah .
milo wotsu so much .
and do you really know me that i 'm going to help the deal on my unternehmerischen ?
yes .
and you know , most of them are two things .
first of all , when we look at the klarheit , we klarheit the achte of the deines of your body , which is that it 's going to be wozu .
because it 's your perception .
and then , after the other hand , you have to think about your own mind .
because , you know , because you 're like the other people feel with your behavior .
the future is always going to happen , if we change our own perception .
do you get it to you ?
yes , i think it 's already .
thank you very much .
all good andré brenner .
yeah .
what do you think about our andré ?
nice .
really , right , gell ?
and how do we hold this moment in the start-up-spirit ?
is this a new innovationskultur ?
i mean , yeah .
clearly .
and i 'm going to see all the time you know .
inspirare is entfachen entfachen .
and that 's what the entrepreneur entrepreneur is .
a schlückchen vom of vom zaubertrank .
and no , so new innovationskultur , ne .
that 's the gründergeist .
it 's about hierzulande in the long days .
from robert bosch , gustav über über zeppelin or oder or wie .
let 's just tell you the spirit of a mind .
and i know that maybe it 's going to be the case of our nächste andré .
you can see , i 'm hochschwanger .
so , maybe it would be naheliegend that i would come up with my kids and the future , because it 's children who will be the future .
instead , that 's the kind of thing that i 'm doing most of time .
i have a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my dad and i went to the program , unternehmertum of the unternehmertum , unternehmertum of gefangene .
we qualifizieren strafgefangene unternehmerisch , which is , you can go to the haft either way , or you can find yourself in a way that you can also find a arbeitsplatz .
so , why did i remember that strafgefangene was that i have people who have never been große enough ?
our program is not far as easy to understand how the die die the children .
and in fact , i thought that the knast of the last place in the universe is that i would work .
what do you think , is that the most important missing factor in your life with people we 're working with ?
we 've found out , these are positive relationships that have male male vorbilder relationships .
and if you think about it , why there are so many erziehungsprobleme and many of them often do have a lot of schulprobleme , it 's often that dad has never made a lot of work that he 's got to make a parent to say that he
and if a siebenjähriger boy darüber young stories about what he would like to live his lives , he might have no longer a better idea , like a life life , it might be a better impact .
and he eifert his father .
i 'm going to start with you in a minute .
martin is a unseres of our program .
his father was alkoholiker , and the whole family has spent the hell of hell .
when he was 12 , his mother died and he and his little family had to go to home .
he was the prellbock of the . .
he was schüchtern and schmächtig and so the perfect victim .
until the other brother , when his wife was bei in an fußballspiel grob , this was all of the . .
there was martin at the zum of the first time , and they went to sicherungen , and they went to the gegner .
and from that day , he was respektiert .
and so we went .
violence has been gehörte to his lives as well as it is .
so what about the one that i 've ever been looking at ?
after all , after all , women became a lot of arbeitslos and they have been arbeitslos .
you do n't know much much different than the most dangerous aktivitäten and your aktivitäten .
and then they 'll come back to the day of the day , where they were all the same thing that their ideas were doing the same thing that were n't there .
what about the belief you believe , when people in the room ?
mostly not much good .
and they 're going to be more efficient in the knast .
they sell a drug drugs on a höheren level , and then they need to be in the haft where they 're einbrechen .
and this leads to germany into germany .
this is in germany , every single second group , is kriminelle rückfällig .
but then there is also in the prison that are really going to change you .
but also , these people are actually einen a stempel on the stirn .
and there it is there .
and everywhere they come , that 's their first identity .
whether you look at a arbeitsplatz , whether you want to find a place where you want to find new private relationships , you 'll be able to do with this identity , with this kind of der , who you have a very in
that 's the problem that we face .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what are the quality of belief , they 're going to make some strafgefangene ?
they 're going to be surprised .
they are unternehmerische skills .
who has a drogenring aufgebaut , and there 's definitely known from marketingstrategien , from marketingstrategien and from . .
it 's a little bit on einzig . it 's a little bit of , , but it 's not a wär wär .
and this is what we want to use as a positives to a human health .
we 're going to build a program with a zwanzigwöchigen education in prison , in three blöcken .
we are the ones of unternehmertum and und .
every student is schreibt in their own businessplan , and every one on a sudden , very teil .
and then we 're going to do this as a result of leute people in the arbeitsplatzsuche of wohnungssuche , in the wohnungssuche of their personal relationships and also a kind of unternehmensgründung .
what 's gründungen for our program ?
it 's a big range of vom from zur to agentur .
we have a tätowierer tätowierer system .
a very large range of time , and i 'm going to introduce you to philipp philipp .
philipps unternehmerisches foundation and his wisdom of the speed of money has been made a lot of the money , and it 's done with the früh trade with kokain .
he always had fun to do business .
he was then zweitausendacht for the first time she had died .
and this haft did n't really beeindruckt anything .
it 's basically the same .
he 's talking today , he 's got his second haft vorbereitet .
zweitausendelf , he was verurteilt for the second time .
he 's just taken into a therapie and then on the therapie .
and there he learned , he could use his own vision for a talent for some legales talent .
he was entlassen in september dreizehn , and then oktober oktober , zweitausenddreizehn gegründet .
läuft agentur is good , and he can live in it .
he 's got very referenzen referenzen .
he 's here today with me .
and to ask , you know , you want to talk to your friend .
and back to the way back to the day , i was following to him .
martin has lost his own education system after his koch and landete in his landete in his freizeit .
and there 's been there and there 's drugs in there , and it was pretty slow down .
he 's working on parallel as she and she 's türsteher .
in fact , years years he 's doing this life .
and he says today that he 's not going to have a lebensstil on this selbstbewusstsein .
one day , he was listening to a schlägerei schlägerei , so it was verurteilt .
he took part of the leonhard-programm part , and the persönlichkeitstraining has ever changed his life .
he learned how he could go to more force more than success and more money , and he could have no fäuste to use his drugs .
and he was so excited about his information so he was so he wanted to use that .
and he wanted to become a part of the . .
that 's geklappt .
it 's now working on the two decades today , and we 've got our teilnehmer to our own lives in the freedom , because we know that if you want to change it , and if you really have the right tools with the hand
the one of those of the successes are of the people 's people .
people who would come back to prison that gave us the externen of us with people , to give our students to their own plänen .
these are our referenten , the ehrenamtliche talks of our students , that are teaching us to be textkorrekturen textkorrekturen , textkorrekturen der .
and these are our mentoren , which are our students sitting on the haft begleiten .
and these people take a lot of our program to do .
one example .
we 're going to do a veranstaltungen that we call a step-to-the-line that 's called . .
we then put it in a middle of the room , and we 're going to have a large klebestreifen of our students on the one and our gäste on the other side .
and then i have to ask different questions .
and every time , every one in the room , this question , he says , he 's looking at the line .
and here 's what we all have in common , whether it 's in the gefängnisses , or we go outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and one of the other things about which is the other thing , the question is , the question is that .
i grew up in a call of brennpunkt , or i had a familienmitglied , which was already even in haft .
there are usually a lot of our teilnehmer at the end of the number of teilnehmer that we 've ever been on the line , very few , of our gäste .
one of the things i want to point is , the one that we all have to go to all of us , the verbindet i 'm going to ask .
so , i 'm going to leave you all .
maybe we can get a little light on the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all right .
amazing .
thank you .
now , i 'm going to ask a question , and if you can ask a question , and if you ask those questions , they 'll never wait .
that 's like our line line up now .
i 've been doing things in the life of my life , which i could have been able to be able to do .
if you ask that question , you do n't answer .
it 's because it 's zählt to be gefahren .
and so far , maybe they have low amounts of marihuana .
it 's not exactly what it does n't mean .
okay .
and it 's also about to make a living <S> , but not all the arbeitskraft that we have to do .
all right .
most of them are sitting .
we have some paar in the room room .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you very much .
in that question , if we ask the amount of veranstaltungen , we get a lot of our grübeln into something like this .
and i 'm also sure how many of you might have been .
happiness with the parents , with the environment that they grew up , with the friends , that they were not going to be able to be able to do something more or the oder of the legalität , or something they did .
what are the results of the work of our work ?
sechzig percent of our prozent finden von during a entlassung .
that 's full fast .
neunzehn percent have already done .
the third of the spender in the last year were leonhard-absolventen .
and our rückfallquote is at seven percent .
i 've been told the seven percent of seven percent percent of the von in germany .
i 'm betriebswirtin .
a strafgefangener cost in bayern per year in the year .
and it 's a beautiful zahlenspiel , auszurechnen , which is a rückfallquote percent of seven percent of a prozent percent of normalerweise percent of normalerweise ersparnis .
when my father and i made the leonhard-programm , we started to know , was quite a verrückt gehalten .
and i had my marketingjob marketingjob in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i did n't do this in my life not in my life .
we 're going to encourage our participants to take responsibility .
responsibility for what happens to happen in the life that is happening to everything about what 's going on to happen in your life .
it does n't hide , it 's not zu .
because it 's too ganz to a ganz , and it allows you to make it safe to the other .
and that 's what makes me happy , and i think about being und and stolz when our clients are open up with their way .
so here 's a little bit of a little video .
movie .
so i 've been verurteilt for two years and eight eight months to be gefährlicher .
i was wurde of verstoß verstoß for three years , and i was verurteilt with 12 months .
i have a gehandelt .
so , i 've got some of the time to get years out of two years , and i think , of course , you know , because of some years , i 'm going to get enough .
i was convicted of this , and körperverletzung körperverletzung , and unerlaubtem handeltreiben with btm .
so , through my own experience , i 've actually changed my complete life .
and what i was interested in this was this persönlichkeitsentwicklung , which was also done .
because there was my case , my strength .
i was not gesellschaftsfähig , i 'm almost gesellschaftsfähig , yeah .
i have taken again again gekriegt my eyes .
and i found out again , i was discovered again , again , again .
and you go to a very different consciousness and selbstbewusstsein of the haft .
so far , it was still more planlos without ohne , and then you 're still going to get back into it .
and they 're going to go back to the leuten people .
well , the problem is that a lot of people are n't going to have to have an anlaufpunkt if the die .
this is the biggest problem , because it turns out that it 's back into the old schiene .
you do n't know anything else .
through this persönlichkeitstraining individuelles coaching , no matter what 's been coming out of it , i think it 's always a way of me thinking of myself , about others , over the problem with problems , with the umgang of society ,
i 've been neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig for my first woman geschieden .
and for me six months ago , i was running with them .
so that 's what we 've been a new relationship .
and because i 've been looking at these different werteunterrichte and lots of other things .
a lot of me , i 've already done .
i 'm in my family again , i started to ausbildung education .
so today , i 'm going to be in heute , i do n't know .
i 'm going to do a vollzeitweiterbildung vollzeitweiterbildung .
you really need to know that it 's very , very many people who actually actually have , like , for instance , my mentor now , and i 'm still going to be around you , and i 'm not sure my emotional hinaus to die people .
i 'm grateful for you to think of this idea that they 've ever been doing .
i 'm grateful to tell you that i 've had a lot of interest in security , and i 'm very grateful that i 've been part of this .
of course , of course , all the people who are die .
i 've been talking to me , with many people , who i 've been talking about , and that i 've already seen that , and that 's good .
and that 's why i 'm going to do it .
and for that , thank you .
get us out in prison .
everybody 's got something that you need .
whether you were to give up to the businessplänen , whether you were to the als of the kommen , whether you were to the referent of the finanziellen , you were in the support of a financial support .
whether you want to put our program in a new bundesland , a thema subject .
let 's talk about it .
martin philipp and i 'm here today .
and let 's play with you .
thank you .
zweitausendneun zweitausendneun , i 'ner bei bei 'ner for hilfsorganisation für in nepal .
in one of the things that i was doing something more little bit of was a . .
there 's some things to do .
it 's for bewerben .
the gehen go .
take a auszeit in the kloster .
there 's actually a lot of ways that we can do today with unzufriedenheit .
you know , beziehungsweise how to get unzufriedenheit .
anyway , i was also unzufrieden .
so with work and so , some of the time .
so , really , i 'm going to have to talk about luxusunzufriedenheit here .
and it 's not a real problem .
my problem was a war siebenundzwanzig , and i was quite quite ausmalen in my childhood 's about 10 , 30 years ago .
it was berechenbar .
and this is what i found .
so , you know , it 's auszudrücken .
in fact , i had eine ausgewachsene .
i do n't know how to do it .
i just do n't just do i just want to go to the path ?
do i do it myself ?
or what would i mean if i was werfe my lebenswürfel up ?
and then what happens then .
what 's going on for me .
these were the thought .
i was in the time of a freie reisejournalistin in a zeit .
as i said , gesagt .
the reisejournalismus war for me was absolute even the absolute traumberuf .
you put the world for free , you could put them into a very good job , and you could bereist the country on a very privilegierte form .
but bereist bereist are very unprivilegierte countries .
developing countries where there 's more to see more , and more specifically than dörfer villages with a lächelnden lächelnden einheimischen , even though they have nothing , to happiness and joy .
but this is a bunch of life , and it 's a reisebericht , a different way .
and that was exactly for me for a while of time .
i was really happy to do so .
it 's on the side .
and also , i found it a little bit of mine to write a country that i 'm really right now to know .
i wanted to change that .
i wanted to get countries , i would say .
you can write your paper .
and to stillen my personal interest .
how do you learn countries ?
it is by something that lives with people .
people are living with people .
not in the hotel .
by the way to deal with the challenges and the challenges of people .
and by working on the people .
at least , that was the answer that i could offer .
and that 's what i wanted to do .
i also wanted to make a sinnvolles .
i wanted to make a difference .
good good .
and that feeling has always verstärkt me on a nepalreise level .
i was already in the world , but in fact , i was also very berührt .
until zweitausendsechs , there was a bürgerkrieg war that there was n't only one of the time that we 've had to deal with a lot of economic and economic problems .
with a jährlichen pro-kopf-einkommen of fünfhundertfünfzig , is the poorest country in south asia .
and it 's very likely to be in the world 's poorest poorest countries .
a quarter of the population lives under the line .
almost a fifth of the population causes of death .
vierzig percent of the users ca n't read and write .
all of these facts connected with a very personal stories and erlebnissen that i met with the journey in my career , in order to be und , and open up to change .
i wanted to change something else .
and that was when i was looking for my rückkehr from my decision .
i was doing my job .
and bewarb me to help .
and i 'm also going to give you a quick short der of the answer that i received at my bewerbung .
because it was just a prägende .
it 's about a seriöse bewerbung bei 'nem international companies .
and not a auffangstelle , for example , for a flippige weltenbummlerin , which has to be more likely to be in leben , and a finanzierung of sucht aufenthalts .
hello everyone ?
is there still ?
my bewerbung was really serious , okay .
at least , i thought that .
and the answer was a bodenlose eine .
i was platt .
and of course , he was written a very answer .
and fortunately , never abgeschickt .
instead , i was going to do it right and make a sense of really fun to make good work .
i used it as a motor to make my own companies .
karmalaya .
heart work and soul travel .
a company that basically basically show you what i 'm looking at .
and the possibility to move a country is different .
the possibility to make a country really is .
by doing , life with life with life .
and it 's not going to work anywhere , but in ausgewählten entwicklungsprojekten .
you could use it in two words .
so karma and laya .
that means very much like a place where you can do good karma .
and you can do good for this .
now this sounds a little bit esoterisch .
it is n't .
karmalaya is a social travel business .
we use tourismus to use a tool for sustainable development .
we use the voluntourismus of werkzeug as a tool for sustainable development .
so volunteering , freiwilligenarbeit and negative .
because the people who are moving towards us as they are leisten in their aufenthalts .
they pay for their journey to build on a bei veranstalter .
but they travel just differently .
they live in gastfamilien .
and the hauptziel is n't not a lot of erholung , or a lot of sightseeing experiences .
social commitment .
and horizonterweiterung .
and we have our je to get our participants in qualifikation and interests in different projects .
we can make ourselves through our work in a tourismus tourismus in the world who would n't have any chance to think about it .
because the only way we need to do is to create the infrastructure .
in other terms of others , we 're using the new paradigm .
we can go to our sustainable work , and we have to build nachhaltige .
so we 're finanzieren for a hundred percent .
it 's not auf .
and this is a very simple part of our very difficult commitment .
we began to work with our work in our work .
vergangenes year , we 've got our engagement on uganda .
and now over about four years ago , i 've been invited to my age and my husband , and i have a team who was a altbekannte question .
do we go away to the geebneten ?
or what would we think about it ?
if we still get the entwicklungsgedanken then we can get more and more ?
if we do n't only social social technology , and how do we get to learn how much more sustainable in the process that is ganzheit development ?
and so that the individual persönlichkeitsentwicklung miteinbeziehen miteinbeziehen ?
or even spezieller individuelle individuelle .
this is basically going to be a new system .
it 's a company that 's going to have to companies .
but in other words , the same philosophy as karmalaya .
do we want it ?
the next question .
'n new companies ?
we do n't want to know that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're ticken .
because we talk the same language .
because we were the same dream of dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and so we went to deshalb a year on this year .
kaliis .
and with kaliis , we make creative companies in their development and our entwicklungsprojekte initiieren that we 've been herausragende through a people .
and that is what we call to the entrepreneurs , the entrepreneurs , or entrepreneurs , creative companies with individual development .
so the coachings of the personal social and the weiterentwicklung of the teilnehmers are beinhalten .
and coachings on the entwicklungseinsatz vorbereiten .
there is a little bit more kaliis around there .
a commitment of a new system is another wissensaustausch .
he 's looking at a very long time where you 're sitting or you 're oder .
now , maybe you have unbewusste vorurteile .
now , maybe you might be able to flexibel yourself in your mind .
and he 's looking at a point where you 're really good .
get a little bit of its eyes .
it 's the idea that creativity is still great .
or it 's the die you get to discover .
you know , you 're not going to be able to change the way that you ca n't change .
and the force to change things that you can change .
and you can get a lot more .
already in a very short time .
we know that .
for example , for example .
this is ruth rose margeret , lydia and selivia .
that 's five and a half women women in uganda .
with traurigen schicksalen and with education .
it fertigen beautiful , handgemachte halsketten for years .
and since nothing has nothing happened .
because they did n't have one .
because they did n't know how to improve the quality .
because nobody told them , which is something that might happen in question .
we wanted to help these women .
and so , in this year , we started a gegründet .
kaliare empowerment product .
products are getting people to protect from poverty .
they give you an income .
the future can be .
we went back here in our online-shop lives .
and we start with a first empowerment .
a limitierte edition of thousands of thousands of thousands of women are women .
it 's not going to make it a second of a year a year .
but it also helps us to make a big difference .
this first edition is quasi social funding and produktstart in a . .
so , if you want to support , you can actually use this to one of the kauf of a kette to the other , but to also go to the end of it .
he can go to women , and they aktiv the aktiv .
at the long time , we do n't want to give five women of women who are sondern or fünfzig .
and it 's not only about uganda , but in fact , in nepal and in other ways that we work with künftig .
but this is a produktbereich project from our integrierten zyklus process .
we 're working on the zentralen areas .
in the area , entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship and health and environment .
because the work in just a space is simply simple .
what happens to children with the women ?
right .
and so in this year , we 've done in nepal , and we 've also zwei two childcare centre .
everything is being greift into our zyklus .
and the whole thing makes sense more than every single project .
we 're actually going to share a lot of qualifikation in the different projects .
and the real possibilities of life , that 's just how they get together .
and for the moment , i want to leave you right now about a journey .
and i want to close your eyes .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're in africa .
in the rural heart of february .
you 're sitting on a hölzernen esstisch .
and it 's zufrieden and satt .
you just went home with your gastfamilie .
there were kochbananenpüree .
matoke .
lecker .
the walls are kahl .
here it is , of course , it 's extremely warm .
you blickst out the window .
and this is the children 's auf at the der .
her flinken feet wirbeln wirbeln the sand .
you blickst on your unterarme .
also , you have a schicht of water .
you get the laugh .
and you call me a name of fun .
you 're dich that you 're not going to read you anymore .
weißhaut .
you do n't know how long it is .
but soon you 're going to get up .
and the lehmstraße , which is still the kids , entlanggehen .
at the end of the street , there 's a großer tree .
this is what you make a lydia with you .
in the wiese , on the edge of the baumes , you will see the new designs of your halsketten .
how do you get to talk to you and hands .
later , there 's still another women .
they smile with erwartungsvoll .
until you 're going to beginnst with deinem .
under the tree .
im .
it 's just that there 's actually internet there .
tomorrow go back to your client .
that 's what you 're going to do .
we need this risk for every time .
and the other thing is , it 's nice to speak again .
you have music music .
and the klirren of geschirr .
mama fiona wäscht in the innenhof die die töpfe .
it 's a afrikanisches song .
you 're ugly and you .
you can go back the eyes again .
each of us can treffen the grundentscheidung to make a new . .
or at least for a short short time , you can take it back again .
and look at what happened .
thank you .
before i start to think , is that what happens to you , who have been here , who has shown him up here .
i 'm not going to go through the light at the bottom , but maybe you want to be someone else .
down here , ' .
two .
now , i do n't know , i 'm not ' , but i 'm not here , but if you 've got here , two , it 's been two , which is beautiful , we 're already too . .
but i also made a building , and it was the villa ice in the east of the city .
that 's the building .
together with 20 other people , i went to besetzt the villa in the last summer six months .
and so i 'm here today , i 'm going to show you tonight .
so , now , some of you might probably say .
what should it be ?
hausbesetzer is many .
but i want to explain it .
now what do you do now to the die ?
and then you go to the park , you know , like , in the park ?
just a small rule of the questions that we know , freunde , my colleagues , have learned how to experience that i am part of a society with me that i have a name of occupy-villa-berg .
all the erwarteten said that we were nahtlos into a series of occupy-bewegung of the occupy-bewegung .
and this is where there were these verbreiteten zelte , verbreiteten and banner .
and to keep the privatisierung of this villa .
but who knows me , this is not my kind of meine .
and it was n't the gewählte protestform of the capital .
what we see here is a sign from the calwer passage in stuttgart .
this is a public space , which is all private , and for many people , there is no one , you know , i do n't say , `` because not in the hand , it 's not possible to be able to use
we were a group of stuttgartern in the wunsch of identitätbildender vereint , stadtraum stadtraum , sensibel and nachhaltig .
and we wanted to tell a different occupy-geschichte .
we were a interdisziplinäres team , and i had to know that this was a very short prototype .
from bereichen , architecture , social -- politics -- stadtforschung -- and kulturwissenschaften stadtforschung , statistics , design , music , music , music , fotografie , fotografie , fotografie .
of course , with different social cultural and personal hintergründen .
our perspektiven ergänzten and bereicherten .
and it allows us to make it in a lot of other ways , but we also have to add it also with different networks .
and creative creates part of the solutions that we 've been doing in the beteiligungsprozess that we 've been doing as durchgeführt .
we actually actually tatsächlich the villa .
but it was just about us , we were die by the stories of stories and the audience .
we have been asking for memory and und .
and from these memories and images , they tried to start to explore the way to explore the perspektiven for villa .
it was important to us process that the process was always konstruktiv .
we 've been initiative in a way that we 've been stets as a plattform plattform and as a result .
so , it was a ein and gedankliches besetzen , and it was besetzen and it went to a nach .
on the experience we have done that , i 'm going to have to do tonight .
every city has identitätstiftende places .
one of them have a different face .
in many cases , these wurden are allerdings and kommerzialisiert , and they become more of the population of being known as a als .
they 're the dead places of a city because they often do n't think of what we do expect in a public space .
so for example , for example , we 've got , .
are these ones , but also , in fact , in public spaces , that urban places are going to be dies .
initiativen that they want to have to live , all the time , are still interesse in the kinderschuhen .
but what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to do with you here , some of the questions here .
i mean , a lot .
these places that our places do n't just have a face .
no .
they 're the social places of our city , where our gesellschaftliches lives live .
so , we often often knüpfen the bande and our neighbors , if we were going to go back to the einkaufen .
and if you can see that , you 're going to have a 'ne opportunity to sit up , and we 're actually going to be able to go back to the spaces that the spaces are also designed .
and we only 'n 'n längeres .
it 's a little bit of ideas , sometimes .
but what is also more important is , a sense of community .
the more , more of the time that i 've done in the public space , the faster and the more it also is , is a community .
and if i do n't have mich , this is what you 're looking at , which is what you call the anonymität of a großstadt .
we then went to two challenges .
we can think of the citizens , the quality of responsibility , and for engagement in their neighborhood , or wiedergeweckt .
how can i get rid of this organization ?
how could it be able to be able to be creative ?
protest against protest and kommerzialisierung , and stadtgeschichtlich bedeutsamen , and kritik the zunehmende and actually zunehmende the same level , and even of the verwahrlosung , and even the same places that are actually equal to the same places .
imagine you 're sitting there , so before you 're watching , you 're going to go to the newspaper , read your text .
love bürgerinnen and citizens , we 're going to let you want to three of them for the neugestaltung of the marktplatzes of die who have been designed for a sorgfältig sorgfältig planungsbüro .
you 're going to be able to get an alternative .
and the possibility that the bürgerstimmen wird is actually umgesetzt .
would you go ?
would anybody get to you with this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds great .
there is 'ne opportunity to was .
you know , you 're going to look around the way back into the future .
and as i said , it sounds just as a moment .
i 'm trying to give myself a explanation .
and that 's because i think you 're not supposed to be gar at oder or either or oder , mitgestalten .
one was , as a klassische , klassische klassische often .
that does n't mean , they do n't have to have a chance to make a , , really , to build a little bit more , and to create a unique alternative , but there 's actually a design that 's already designed , and they 're going
or , like a friend ago , what color does have the mülleimer .
second explanation of classic klassische is about taking information on information .
think about three drei .
we have what we 're doing , and we want to show you , and then we 'll give you the one .
bats and unverständnis are often the stuff i think i think are quite useful .
i do n't like to make a decision about geranien or stiefmütterchen if i 've never had to 'ne strecke statt .
but it 's also different .
now , with the der of vorhandenen beteiligungsfrustration , a lot of gespräche , we 've learned how much we 've learned .
and we 've been using these experiences , and i want to share with you today .
i 'd like to encourage it to other people , in other words , but also , to the most important in terms of the politics and the . .
because those are the ones who are actually going to do to be able to do that , and that 's what they 're going to be used to use .
and if that 's really what 's really interested in a treatment , as it seems to be und and betont , it 's going to be betont , and then we need the verantwortlichen new beteiligungsformate .
but it was nicht to me , and i 'm just going to show you all that you 're sitting here today .
and that 's why i believe in a very important way .
i 'm going to tell you , for the reason , that you 're all going to go , and i want to give you some of our examples of our bürgerbeteiligung yet to get a chance .
and i richte them all because they 're the ones who can make a new beteiligungskultur .
so we have to look at the same thing to look at , as , to be able to believe , and the responsibility and the für for their communities and how to do it in terms of the same and the beteiligung that we have to do ?
first of all , for example , bereitschaft for the dialog .
in beteiligungsprozessen , entrepreneurs have laien , bürger , bürger people , projektverantwortliche and und interests .
what we see here is a picknick system that we asked .
so what we 're seeing here is bezirksräte and gemeinderäte in the conversation with the citizens .
the goal must be that every single thing that 's going on in augenhöhe is that , not the interessen or interests of interest in the kompetenzen of the people .
the citizens in the world are experts , and they are experts in the neighborhood , they know experts , and they do n't know what they 're doing , and they are kindheitserinnerungen into a place where a lot of where they have is a place .
the projektverantwortlichen , everything in the city , is trying to make sure what to do in the ebene level .
in einzelfall , in a sense of this case , there are more likely to be the themen ergänzen that are going on the project in je .
this is going to be a ideenfindungsprozess , where all the information can be available with everyone , and then it can be able to work .
you might be able to get rid of the spuren that get to the spuren .
a program that means that the desire is actually going to be seriously seriously .
and then , if i say , if somebody says , i want to give you a . on the . .
of course , it can be völliger quatsch , but the goal has to be in in with all of us all , with what is the right solution , and maybe in the zweifelsfall process , maybe the unterzubringen , but maybe in a different place .
as i said , this is going to be out of the idea .
second point is different beteiligungsformate .
our stadtgesellschaft is bunt .
one feels like being able to say to be a lot of gruppe group .
another question is , to be able to write a little bit , a group that 's 'ner at the top of the number of großen .
maybe another monkey might be more or a fotografiert .
or you have to put your ideas in mindmap .
what i mean to say , there 's going to be a beteiligungsformate geben to be um to unterschiedlichen .
we have the opportunity to take a chance to get there to be there , just to go out there .
in the same 'ne little little . .
we have the possibility to have an , .
we had the opportunity to paint .
we 've had the ability to write .
unabhängig of age .
this was a fünfjähriges girl .
we had the possibility to connect our ideas with their hands and verorten .
also , the way that we can see outside of zeitunabhängig zeitunabhängig is that they will be gegeben .
for example , for example , for example , about a internetportal , this can happen to 'nen projektraum .
the zeitnahe and the verfügbarkeit of the verfügbarkeit verfügbarkeit the results under the beteiligten .
so we even den the whole process of facebook , and on the bottom of it , talking about it , and it 's a second zeitnah of über , and it 's good news .
our third point .
you may remember that i 'm often beteiligungsprozesse that i 'm often late late .
in my erfundenen experiment , there were three three planungen .
but ergebnisoffen is the process , but only when it 's frühzeitig frühzeitig and the verantwortlichen im does n't even know what to be 'nem 'nem .
if you get through the dialog , and i 'm going to go back to the point where i 'm going to go to you and erörtert what 's going on for a areal .
ergebnisoffenheit ergebnisoffenheit is probably the same self .
and then , when the first time is made up with the fact that this was an event that was veranstaltung as a veranstaltung event , so it was the same for the experience .
what 's happening now is that , when citizens are ihre their way through their city and their ihre .
it 's already in a lot of places .
i 've got an example from stuttgart , for example , the ist , is probably a lot of this .
in new york , this was a project , and it was about a flussschwimmbad .
in 'ner crowdfunding-kampagne , there 's been a $ dollar dollars in a few hundred years that has been able to do the finanzierung or oder at least .
time , in the course , we did n't know , politik the company , the lack of it was not different than the idea to start with your own .
also , the in in new york , which i 'm not glaub to tell you , is because he 's not going to tell you more , because it 's the world of the world , and touristenmagnete is not an idea of politics and health .
the opposite , the abrisspläne , for abrisspläne , has been fest .
in jena , we 're back in germany that the citizens have already been pläne for the verabschiedete of a platzes .
the city was actually at the time not bürgerbeteiligung .
the four weeks of planauslage , we 've been für for 'nen , which are completely als than bürgerbeteiligung .
today , the informationsseite is the offline .
while the side of d seite is wonderful and the city of the die , who have the gegründet , who has been da , and others unterstützt .
andernorts , her citizens zebrastreifen their own zebrastreifen .
in fact , a crowdfunding-finanzierte fußgängerbrücke .
all right , well , at all , you 're going to be okay .
so we 're just going to get that so .
but i think it 's wrong to make the city out of responsibility .
why ?
for one , because you 've got a look for you , you should have to have a look .
as the result , the citizens who will be initiativen or companies in the rule of you , in a sense , in terms of the form of the focus , the relationship is the responsibility of the
and then , of course , if the city started to look at the projects , the other way that the city is , the other ones are also going to be .
a ehrenamtliche society can only do this mühevoll .
our goal was our temporäre , which was a initiative initiative , who was about ergebnisse a year , and the responsibility was about to tell us the stories of the city .
aktueller was a investor member of gekauft villa in january .
it 's still verhandlungen .
and unfortunately , we have the problem , and we do n't think the problem we can not have the responsibility yet .
but we know , at all , we know , as well , as the city has villa the villa , if the verhandlungen are actually successful , if it 's actually a stattfinden .
in the form of the situation , it 's still open .
to finish , i 'm going to tell you that a lot of projects , the ones that the way of the importance of complexity , the complexity , or the number of the city has become a chance to have sex zustimmung
if you only just time and work with the citizens .
it 's in a city of town and citizens .
in the context of town , and everybody 's going to sit here to you here .
if we demand our einbringen , and at the end of the time , the entscheidungsträger of the citizens will not be more like a lästig , but as a gewinnbringend .
that 's it .
yesterday , after generalprobe , we were there in albstadt , and we went to the ins .
we talked about reinkarnation .
so this idea , even though , is a great opportunity to have , if you do n't have geklappt , if you have n't seen the second second time , the second time you have is .
we found something very exciting .
and we were pretty fast to get that there were two things that we could just experience before .
one is the pubertät .
the second thing was , then , at the end of the day , at the moment , at the table , at the table , at the table , at the table ?
it 's done .
no way .
school , some of you may remember hefte raus .
yes , it 's like , now , the last year , it 's been her years , but the words are at me happy with my hands .
my hals schnürt together , and i want to leave it back .
and then i do n't know , as you said , at the end , if i was in my prüfungen , it was always the ernst of the ernst , which is always thinking of me with the der .
no idea what was made of what was happening .
you will be able to understand it , so my school was n't really beautiful , and after i got my letzte abi-prüfung behind my father was completely clear , i was n't sure .
and what i 'm going to tell you is that if i was in the year zweitausendvierzehn , i was going to show some of the most 200 days that i 've spent , i 've done in schools .
with begeisterung and vollkommen and begeisterung .
how did this come from ?
how could this happen ?
this is just starting to think that something happened is that i ca n't deal with it .
i got kids .
so my wife was the children .
and therefore , it was clear that it was diejenige to kümmern this schulkram .
until then , one day , when she was said , it 's schatz .
and today , you leave .
yes , elternabend .
there i was opening up the door , and then i was looking into this sort of und and a boah , and i felt zurückversetzt in the achtzigerjahre .
this looked exactly what it looked like .
and the roch also kind of like damals at the time , and i dacht myself , and i said , `` well , here 's what changed us is .
and then when i asked the patient to tell them , and you know , the kids do n't learn to school , but for me , i live there , and i 'm happy to say , oh my god , i did n't have
what is it that we 've been from school school , who really did have been mitgenommen ?
so a lot of us have been doing something right now .
where have you ever been able to have a good time in your life ?
and maybe some of you have to know how the hauptstadt of the jugoslawien are called .
what 's the time ?
or wissensbulimie , wissensbulimie , can all have a long time in a way that reinzustopfen a lot of time , just to do it for es , can i get a auskotzen ?
well , i 've got the time for gebraucht , but otherwise ?
and what does a abi-schnitt tell you about one of the other side of someone who has been a good doctor ?
whether the empathisch is and whether the good diagnostische properties ?
no way .
so , no way , it 's your life , for us , it 's not for school .
if we look back , like this , over zweihundertfuffzig years , the center of the achtzehnten century , the mag would have been . .
this is the time in germany that 's been schulpflicht completely irgendwann .
and as the schulsystem , as we have today , it has its roots .
and if we imagine the time at time , it was actually that people who did n't have access to all of the time .
and there were those four or six years when they were forced to go to school school , and know , well , they were really the only way they had , and to understand the knowledge and the information of the time .
today , a dreizehnjähriger dreizehnjähriger of information in his pocket than the largest library of the day .
and the middle century , this was the time of industrialisierung .
that means that there 's some changes in the world , and there are suddenly people who need to have some people that have these new machines .
but at the same time , people were also going to need to give the people who were able to wait and get these machines .
and we needed people who people who could build machines and build these factories .
maybe it may be familiar .
the dreigliedrige schulsystem that we have in germany now in its place has its content in this time .
and there 's no sense of it .
also , because it was probably something that i was in the school that i 've learned to school in the fließband , who is at the fließband , who is the day , and it was in the day .
let 's take a look look at the future .
let 's take the achtzehnte century where it is , and let 's look at the year of zweitausend .
the year was zweitausend years ago , and the year was the first internetblase to platzen .
i was done with my research , and i thought , well , at the moment , i 'm going to go to you now , the first one .
yes , some of you spend me in the same way , with the internet , i 'm going to go , i 'm going to go back , and i 'm going to go back to you .
and some companies are vorbeigeschossen to us , and they are increasingly bigger and increasingly , and we 're so slow and we 've got a lot of them , and some of the companies are also wieder into the freien .
you see it only time in life .
and we had , for instance , a couple of years ago .
so , we had this kind of growth , and we had this kind of an of bord on top of the , like webdesigner , app-entwickler . .
i do n't know if you have konkrete konkrete idea that these people do , but when i did n't go to school , we did n't have a idea that it would take the case .
even when i was abi , i did n't talk about this as a dem .
and the kids that we send in school today is what 's going to be in 10 , fünfzehn , or maybe , have a thousand years ?
the only honest answer is to be ahnung .
and what do you know the facts are going to be successful in the future jobs ?
and if you 're honest , the only thing that we do is have no idea .
and because we get to be able to look at the future of the audience , because i could give you the lottozahlen for the . .
there 's 'nen jackpot , which i read .
well , you see , you do n't know .
so how do we get out what do we have to learn ?
what are the things that we need to make children of their lives ?
and maybe it might help us look at what 's companies for what is going to happen to have .
this is the abnehmer of school , yes .
the absolventen of school schools , and then come to the companies .
and if you look at the classic klassische klassische , you know , first of all , yes , it 's the first time .
so that 's what we 're saying , so then , then they 're going to read , we 're going to read 'nen , hochschulabsolventen , mit with 10 years of berufserfahrung , and 12 years back into the time .
that 's now going to school in school and in the future .
but i 'm going to get school to do that , the things that are being important , that 's what 's called the soft soft , and i am convinced that these soft skills are going to be the skills of the future .
and you can actually do it in the three groups .
that 's for one company , which is a mitarbeitern who who are mitarbeitern , so that 's not a flexibilität .
then almost all the company got to think of unternehmerischem .
and then , the company who are trained to have these die are these die .
so , we have unternehmerisches unternehmerisches thinking about teamfähigkeit .
let 's start with . .
that 's pretty fast , too quickly .
when we look at how we do today , the economy works , how fast it is , how fast changes everything .
produktlebenszyklen , all the models that make up on the internet is going to go to tomorrow .
there 's a need for me to have to be able to do that with this change .
there i am going to have to have a brauch that i mean .
there 's been some practice i 've got to have .
this is pretty exactly the opposite of what happened in the factory end of the end of the end of the mitarbeitern century .
the second thing i want to think about is that this is clear .
it 's about responsibility .
there 's about people who are taking responsibility .
first time , her and her life .
but also , for the whole big .
whether it 's the company is to be the same as a society , we want to take people about the responsibility of the whole .
and the third factor , the teamfähigkeit , which will be almost most successful in many cases .
and if we remember an at the fußball , there was a beautiful there in the internet .
argentinien argentinien 'nen portugal has portugal , and has a team .
it was n't philipp lahm that the gewonnen won .
they could only do that in common .
and so , like that , for example , this big innovator of our time , steve jobs , ja .
it was n't that the der invented , which was invented the imac imac , who did n't invented it , which did n't have any of them .
the one had a team that made it possible , just as a team who could create the way they did .
so school 'ne , this might be able to tell these three things , which is a school school , that we have a lot of life for life .
but there 's still fourth fourth point , and it 's almost more important .
and that 's learning .
if the only thing we can tell about the future of security is that it 's not unsicher , but the ability to learn new , and also , to learn it to be the way that our children in the future are successful ,
but that 's what happened to me with 'ne who are diese these things .
but where was i ?
i was sitting in this elternabend room , and the one of you , the kids , that know that this is not a veranstaltung event , you know , you have to pay for . .
now , at the time , this particular event , though , was n't there yet .
at the time , where elternvertreter is going to be hit , all of these things will be safe .
yes , i said there , and i said , and what i should tell you about the schullaufbahn of a couple of these children was this elternabende noch of the event .
less spaßig , it was for me as a parent , when if the rund rund around the topic , the lernen would start to gesamte the whole familienleben .
less less fun , and when it 's child , it is stress .
and eventually , the schullaufbahn and the endete ended up , and was the höhepunkt of the schullaufbahn on this school , and then wieder with this schullaufbahn an .
in fact , it was n't a elternabend , but it was kind of a elternnachmittag like this , but it 's right now , in the last hour and in fact , we were also the only parents who was invited to the meeting .
and i 'm going to ask you now , and i 'm going to go through the details of the time , and we need to get our child out there , that 's not true .
but vorangegangen are only two years where we 've met , and there 's no way .
what are we going to do wrong ?
and we actually have the question that was we kaputt ?
and are we just the only ones they do it ?
i 've been in the last two years since i 've been working on a lot of people who i 've been talking about , and i 've been talking about it , i 've learned about it , i 'm afraid .
there are many things that are pretty much different from it , and it was two years ago , because there were two jürgen that i was working with the new müller gerade , who was at the end of the
and what i want to say , he 's almost almost a story of the story story , and he 's almost a erlebt experience , and we have been the same thing , and we had the lucky that we were n't going to have our kids out
in berlin , there is a einerseits riesenauswahl of unterschiedlichen schools , and we have actually privatschulen privatschulen in betracht .
but can everyone do this ?
somehow , it was so much to make us to make our children in our own lives , and they would be able to do it out there , as they were .
and after we both both the way , school has gone since we 've been so far , we all have this idea , well , we 're the first ones that are going to do now .
just how to we as a quereinsteiger of something that 's important ?
the good news is that we have getäuscht getäuscht .
we 're not alone .
but we found that relatively quickly , a whole bunch of great people , which were very what they wanted to do , to school , who are being schule all the stories .
it 's not like this is only the kids and your parents are suffering from what 's happening out there often .
if we look at the teachers , most of the teachers have burnout .
so if we look at the way that the number of krankheitstage in the last 10 years , it changed half .
can it be that every parents make their wrong ?
that all the kids are kaputt , and those teachers are kaputt .
or can it be that we have a heart that 's simply not so much more like this , like this hochzeitsanzug vor fünfundzwanzig fünfundzwanzig , that simply does n't work so much .
and we found lots of people found what they were doing , and we even found people who do n't have children .
and they understood that they have to take responsibility for the future that they have to take responsibility for the future they need responsibility to be the way they give our children and the children who are now in school to go to the way .
and we have 'ner second life geirrt , there are all kinds of tollen out there , and all of the world who are doing to have to do , and there are vorbildliche schools here , and there 's really great school , and there 's almost great
and there is even a ein or other mutigen that der then traut the first step .
and how should we do to quereinsteiger als ?
we did n't have a concept to do that now that we could go through it .
but we can do a thing , we can go to those schools , and we can go to these schools , to the school , who , for school , to teachers , the teachers , the students , and the ones , and the ability to teach
so , there are people who are working on the way that we 've been working on this past so that we 've been doing this for the last time , and learning about the two things that it means to work with it .
these are mit with konkreten , and they do solve the konkreten of the things that we use .
and after two days , then , in the developed , there was a new leitbild , or den for the very gegeben für for wie completely dürfen to the wir school .
or you have konkrete problems in the issues of mobbing problems that you have in your school .
within two days , a few years ago , i think that will be being umgesetzt in the next few days .
but what is the most amazing thing about this two days , and that makes me so beautiful to me , that i 'm so beautiful for the last few years that i 've been , and i 'm going to spend a lot of schools in the germany
if the three things together together , they actually , like flexibilität flexibilität .
so quasi quasi , thinking , as you experience as a team .
then that 's a funken , der überspringt .
and if we first four months after so workshop at the end of so , we learned that at the end of school , we learned that we were 'ne for a new culture .
and this is incredibly geil .
and i ' myself , i think , to talk about school .
i 'm going to go back to you to think about school .
and i 'm not going to point to you in the way that they 're talking about , to talk .
talk about what they 're doing , but they 're talking about what they 're doing .
they will be surprised , as far as they zuspruch , and how many people have the same same , but they do n't talk about it .
let 's bring them every single school in germany in the 21st century .
let 's change the entire education .
and let 's do the things that people in the day for the day , with parents , the teachers and the students .
because we only can make it together .
thank you .

when steve lopez , the kolumnist came out -- again , by the streets in the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a afro-amerikaner , sympathisch , , , obdachlos , who was on a geige die that had only two players .
many of you will know the story , because from steves article about this book , he was a book that was wiederum again , and robert downey , when jamie anthony und als steve nathaniel , the kontrabassisten who was am at the juilliard-konservatorium
nathaniel verließ left , and a einen and a half of them later , he lived in the north of skid row in the center of los angeles , im in the von of los angeles .
i 'm going to encourage you to read steves steves 's book , and look at the movie , so that she does n't really understand the wonderful verbundenheit that can have been between these guys -- but also that the music was to work , and how they
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in the disney disney north bronx .
he was just having a vorführung of beethovens and und sinfonie 's und , and he came to the stage to show me .
he talked to a very heiteren and geselligen geselligen about yo-yo english and hillary clinton and talking about how the dodgers never had to be in the baseball world , and that was because of the tückischen passage of the first geige in the last geige
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , in fact , that nathaniel was a interessierte .
i have to say that there is a medical treatment for nathaniel treatment , because it was already with elektroschocks and mit and handschellen and a trauma , a trauma that was going to be there .
now , as a result , it 's particularly anfällig for these schizophrenen phasen , and it 's sometimes bad , and it 's been verschwindet , and he 's tagelang out of the way of his tagelang row , and he folterqualen the horror and the und of
and in fact , when genau was a einem , when we started with our first unterrichtsstunde in the disney disney van , he had this irre flackern in his eyes and was lost lost .
he was talking about dämonen and smoke , and he wanted to call him what she had in the head .
i was afraid , not my sondern , but i knew i was going to be able to lose him , because i could make him his beziehung into the und , and that i could make him his relationship with wenn , and when i started to talk
so i just started to play .
i played the first sentence of beethovens violinkonzert .
and while i was , i realized , that in the eyes , there was a change change .
it was as though he was under the effects of invisible invisible , a chemical reaction , my play was my game .
nathaniels manischer zorn verwandelte on the way in which he plays and smile .
and as a miracle , he took his geige and started to play , and some of ausschnitte spielen ausschnitte and asked me to play them to the end , `` mendelssohn , tschaikowski , sibelius .
and we started talking about music , where the über was about über , brahms , bruckner , and all the other bs , from the bis to the esa-pekka .
and i realized that he did n't just have an wissen knowledge about music , but it was also a whole personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion , and a sense that i only only heard my colleagues in the gulf of los angeles .
by his music , through music and music , it came out of this , , verwirrten man who was still filled with the streets of los angeles , a liebenswerter , gebildeter , ausgezeichneter , in juilliard musiker .
music is medicine . it 's changing us .
for nathaniel , music means music .
because the music allows him to explain his thoughts and wahnvorstellungen with the help of his imagination and creativity into something .
and so he entflieht his quälenden zuständen .
i understood that that is the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music : so that we make something that makes us think of ourselves in deep inside the way , in our sense , in our own sense , our emotions , through our own sense ,
and the reality of this is erreicht every single day , and it 's going to come from , inspired , and it 's all of us .
what nathaniel anging was , so back to him , was back back into a community of friends .
the erlösende force of music took him back to a family of musicians that understood him that his mind has been und and ihn .
and i 'm always going to go back to musizieren music , whether it 's egal disney or hall hall , because it reminds me to why i 'm becoming musiker .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
morton bast
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit of a ich i 've ever been cellisten of the cellisten .
i hope you 're happy .
so , i 've got a lot of fish in my life .
i only have two .
this first , it was more like a leidenschaftliche affäre .
it was a beautiful fish , wohlschmeckend , good konsistenz , gehaltvoll , a bestseller on the speisekarte .
what a fish .
more importantly , it 's been in aquakultur after the world 's grand höchsten .
so you could think of it to make it a . .
i had this connection with the beauty of a new months .
one day , he was the der company , and he said , if i could have been able to do with the event , i would have to talk about sustainability .
of course , i said .
there was a company that was trying to solve what this was the problem that we have today has taken us .
in the last 50 years , we 've seen the gefischt species of how we wir forests .
it 's very hard to make the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the thunfische , the heilbutte , the , , the , , schwertfisch , they 're in charge .
it 's almost longer long .
so , maybe some übel , aquakultur , fischanbau .
well , the question of this -- fischzuchtanlagen verschmutzen , the environment , most of you , are of all of them , and they 're ineffizient , let 's thunfisch . a huge amount .
he 's got a futterverwertung of 15 to one .
this is 15 pounds of nötig , so that 's kind of a pfund zucht-thunfisch .
not very sustainable .
it also do n't quite good .
so here was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted them to read them .
the day before , in the event , i was rief the chef of the öffentlichkeitsarbeit for the company .
let 's call it don .
`` don , '' i said , `` just to get the facts right , you 're famous for it , so far out in the sea , that you do n't get the environment . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said . `` we 're so far that the der is going to be verteilt by fish , and not konzentriert . ''
and then he fügte , `` we 're in a eigene world .
this is from 1 to a 2.5 , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
2.5 to one , great .
`` 2.5 to one ? what are you füttert ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said .
and at that night , i was sitting on the night , and i thought , `` what 's the point of a protein ?
so i went to the next day , first of the event , don .
i said , `` well , what do we mean , are , of course ?
he said , he does n't do that . he will nachfragen .
now , i was going to put a bunch of people in the company , and no one had one of my ordentliche to go to the leitenden foundation .
let 's call it don .
`` don , '' i said , `` what if we know , what are terrorism ?
now , he 's got some algae and some algen and they said , `` hühnchen-pellets . ''
i said , `` hühnchen-pellets ? ''
he said , `` yes , federn , skin , knochenmehl , reste , getrocknet and zu . ''
i said , `` how much percent eures eures futters is chicken ? ''
in particular , perhaps one is two .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` don , what is sustainable about verfüttern ?
there was a long time in the sky , and he said , `` there 's just too many chicken in the world . ''
i 'm going to tell you about that fish .
no , not , because i 'm a selbstgerechter genießer and gutmensch .
that 's actually what i 'm doing .
no , i 'm nein micht from this one fish , because , i know , god in god who has fish come to him with the chicken .
this is fish , which is another type of liebesgeschichte .
it 's the romantic way of thinking of the kind of behavior that you think that you have to get your hands out in your fish , you have the liebt .
i had tried to get a place in a restaurant .
a befreundete event had been talking about this fish .
they 've made a lot of gewissermaßen .
he came to the table with a light , almost schimmernden white color .
he had a koch hatte .
wait .
and it was pretty köstlich .
who can make a fish feel so well after he verkocht ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
call it miguel . in fact , it 's miguel .
and no , he did n't have fish fish , and he 's not a banjo . at least the way they 're and i can see .
he 's a biologe at veta la .
this is a fischaufzucht in the südwestlichen corner .
it 's close to the mündung of the river .
until then , in the 1980er , the farm was in the hands of argentiniern .
they were fleischrinder fleischrinder on what 's called the feuchtgebiete .
they did that by the way to land the country .
they built the complicated result of kanälen , and they put it out of the land and out of it .
well , they could n't make the difference that it was n't , not effective .
and it was a disaster .
it 's about 90 percent of the birds to find what 's going on for a place .
and this is a 1982 company that has a umweltbewusstsein company to umweltbewusstsein the country .
what did they do ?
they have the fluss of the water .
they literally literally hebel the hebel .
and instead of herauszudrängen the water , they used the water to um the water .
they fluteten the kanäle .
they created a 11.000 hektar -- a , , meeräsche , , , aal -- aal -- and miguel and seine and firma , which the destruction of the destruction of the ocean .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this .
they 're looking out at the bottom of a place that 's a million miles away , and everything you see are going to be geflutete black and these dichte , üppige age .
i was n't there any time ago with this .
he is an incredible guy , three parts of darwin , and he 's part of a krokodil for the woman .
okay ? there we were , and we were taking us through my feuchtgebiete and i keuche and i schwitze , and matsch , bis up to my knien , and hält in .
and he hebt a seltenen gleitaar .
now he erwähnt the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
and here , there 's a pattern of bündeln , which ihn him into the tansanische .
it turns out that that 's what you 've been doing with the part of his career in the national crime in crime .
i asked him how he got to become a fisch-experten .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know anything fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then it goes , and it 's stürzt in more gerede of these birds and algen and seltsamen wasserpflanzen .
and i do n't know why that was really fascinating , you know , you know , you know , the biotische community of , , the so .
it 's great , but i was love .
and my head was schwach with this verkochte piece of köstlichen fischs , which i had on the vorabend .
so i was going to get it down . i said , `` solomon , how does it make you fish as well ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know young , the french , the , , the relationships , is incredible .
but what do they eat their fish ?
how is the futterverwertung ? ''
now , he says , he says he tells us that it 's such a reichhaltiges system , that the food they eat in the wild .
the pflanzliche , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , the zooplankton , that 's what the fish füttert .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely selbsterneuernd .
there is no food .
the one of the other people who have heard the farm are not their füttert ?
and then on the day , i was on this site , with me , i was going to put it on , and i asked him , and i said , `` for a place that is so of course , it 's something that i 've had
at the moment it was like a ein ein would have a bühnenwechsel .
and we took around the corner , and we gave the bot down to the anblick thousands of thousands , and thousands of abertausende , , buchstäblich , literally literally teppich buchstäblich , and literally buchstäblich reicht .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your bäuche . ''
they schlemmen . ''
schlemmen ? i was completely verwirrt .
i said , `` solomon , do n't you put your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern of the birds .
now last year , this was on the grundstück mountains , birds , more than different different species .
today , it 's the largest and one of the most important public vogelreservate in europe .
and i said , `` well , is that a big vogelbestand problem not last last thing that you want to do with a fischaufzucht ? ''
he schüttelte his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building extensiv , not difficult .
this is a ökologisches network .
the flamingos eat the die .
the fressen eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker is , the better the weight .
okay , let 's think about this , a farm that does n't change its animals and und a farm that does your success for the health of their own .
a fischaufzucht , but also a vogelreservat .
oh , and by the way , the sollten should be not diese .
they brüten in a city of kilometer , where the die is better for the nestbau .
every morning , they 're 240 miles to miles .
and every night , they fly out kilometer miles .
they do that because they can follow the white white line .
seriously .
and i had some sort of a der of the victims , and i looked at it .
and i said , `` stop , do you go to kilometer miles of kilometer to the farm and you 're going to 240 240 miles away ? ''
do you do it for the kids ? ''
he looked at me as a while , i was a lied song .
he said , `` no . you do what that means you eat .
i did n't remember the skin of my geliebten fisches , which was made , and i do n't like fischhaut . i do n't like you sautiert . i do n't like it . ''
it 's this beißende , beißende .
i 'm not going to do that with that .
and yet , when i 've tried to sie them in this , in this case , they do n't have nach nach .
she was süß , and she was playing with her own when she wants a ozean of the ocean .
i mentioned the gegenüber and miguel .
he said , `` the skin is like a schwamm .
it 's the last abwehr before it comes to the body .
they 've evolved over the course of evolution in order to unreinheiten unreinheiten . ''
and then he fügte , `` but our water has no keine . ''
okay . a farm that does not have their fish . it 's a dog that has its own misst on their success .
and i realized , if he says a farm that does n't have unreinheiten , he 's gewaltig , because the water that das through this farm is aus from the river guadalquivir .
it 's a river that allows all the things that the von of which are neigen , where they 're now heutzutage , they are , to have chemische schadstoffe of schädlingsbekämpfungsmitteln .
and if it has taken through the system , and this verlässt is the water itself , as it is hereingekommen .
the system is healthy , it reinigt the water .
so not only a farm that has not tiere your animals , not just a farm that has to pay you to your health , but a farm that is literally a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage , and it 's like fish , and it 's
because when the water herausfließt , it versinkt in the atlantic .
a tropfen in the ocean , i know , but i suppose it does , and that should also be true , because this is a , , as though , but also , it 's also aufschlussreich .
you might say that you 're a recipe for the future , whether we 're talking about barsch or fleischrindern .
now , what we need is now a radical new concept of agriculture , from one of them in the food , actually , it 's good .
but for many people , that 's a little bit too radical .
we 're not realisten , we are genießer .
we love wochenmärkte . we love small familienbetriebe . we 're talking about local food . we eat bio .
and if you tell the fact that are the good news , the future news , the one that 's going out there is somewhere else , and they say , `` hey , people like pinke flamingos , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like that question .
no , not , because we already have enough calories to get the world more than just .
a billion people will be hungern today .
a billion -- that 's more than the rest -- because of aufgrund krasser in the atmosphere , not the gesamtproduktion .
well , i do n't like that question because they do n't have the logic of the nahrungssystems 50 years .
füttere getreide getreide at schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel of chemicals , chemikalien chemicals on the erde , hühnchen of fish , and the whole time has been to ask , `` when we save more people less like this , can be so ? ''
that was the beweggrund . . it was the . . it was the geschäftsplan of the agriculture .
we should call them what she is , which is a gewerbe in abwicklung , a gewerbe , a gewerbe , schnell schnell kapital , that allows the production of these growth .
this is not a gewerbe , and it 's not agriculture .
our kornkammer is now under threat , but it 's not because of ressourcen resources .
not by the latest mähdrescher- and traktor-erfindungen , but through the country , through nicht , of pumpen , through water , not by by kettensägen water , through by kettensägen , and by the way , and by the way .
you want to support the world ?
so let 's start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that every cell community will provide themselves ?
to do that , you do n't look at the agrarindustrie-modell for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are obenan at it , and it never has made a good thing to eat .
so let 's go back to the model model .
that 's the equivalent for two billion years of . .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
in fact , these are not the same worlds to interact , like companies , which are instead of anstatt , betriebe , betriebe , are not a intensiv only way of people who are not just erzeuger , but experts for relationships .
because they 're the ones who are also experts who are in the way .
and if i 'm really honest , you 're a better depression than i ever ever ever .
you know , that 's right , because if the future is good food , it will be köstlich .
thank you .
if i want to näherbringen you with this point , it 's that the gesamtheit of the data that we consume are larger than the sum of their parts , and instead of informationsüberladung , to möchte , i think you can think about how we can use information
so what we 're seeing here is an early sterbediagramm nach age .
the program i 'm using here here is a little little experiment .
it 's called pivot and what i can do with pivot , that i can give up to a certain todesursache , we 'll cheat .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that makes it .
and that is because of the mittelbereich here , people are here in the aktivsten , and they 're over here in the gebrechlichsten .
we can go ahead and take a further and see the data and see that the und and the animal are verdächtigen , and not for everybody .
now , if we go to the time , and after the age of sagen , we 're going to have 40 years or 40 , or , 40 years ago , we see that we 're still a unfälle of life that we have to worry about the
and who weiterforscht weiterforscht is that , in fact , that 's particularly especially men .
so you can see that , information is data from this kind of information , and it 's very sehr .
and if we can do this for rohdaten , why are n't such a inhalte for the content ?
what we 've got here now is all the titelbilder of all of the individual illustrated that have ever been shown .
it 's all there . it 's all online .
you like to do it with my talk to your zimmern .
with pivot , they can be in a decade .
you can go into a particular year .
you can go directly to a certain note .
now , if i look like this , i see the athleten that 's going to be in the front of the ausgabe and the sportarten .
i 'm a lance , a armstrong , and i klicke , and i hierhin my way back at the moment that i 'm going to show you up to armstrong armstrong .
now , if i want to get just a gröberen überblick data , i think , `` ok , what if i do everything about the subject to the subject ? ''
so i go to step , and then die the other .
now i see organic lemond .
and so you get a idea that if you sit down into this kind of information , breiter , breiter , reinzoomen , rauszoomen , if you do n't , or maybe you ca n't just do it or do n't just be surft .
you make something that 's different .
it 's something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i want to leave this idea a little bit about something like a little crazy .
what we 've done here is we 've got every single wikipediaseite , and we put them every one and we put it on a little zusammenfassung .
and the answer is just going to take a short übersicht and a symbol for the area of this .
i 'm just going to show you the top of the top 500 of the populärsten .
but even in this eingeschränkten view , we can also do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are based on wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose the issue of the ' .
now , when i 'regierung 'regierung , i know the wikipediakategorien that i have , the most damit of all , is that the die of the people who are going to come back to the moment of the year .
this is really important because this is a realization that is not in a single wikipediaseite .
it 's just because you can see a step out of it , and it 's looking at all .
schauend on a bestimmte of these zusammenfassungen , i can go back to the next time , `` people '' come back to the year , and see .
now , if i look at all these people , i think that the majority of it is -- some of us who are kommen , some of them , some less , come from the economy . here 's one at home . and one of the
and interestingly , now , is a professor ted .
so we can go back and throw a look at all ted ted .
you see , we 're looking at the web as a second as it is , but it 's a very web , not just looking at it , but it 's very much .
and that 's what i want to show you a different surprise surprise .
i 'll just show you just about the new york times .
pivot , this kind of -- i do n't want to call it a plane ; it 's really not a browser , but you can look at webseiten with -- and we 're going to take this zoom-technologie
so i can go one step step , and i want to go straight to a certain sektion .
that 's important because you 're just going through the maps of hands in this way , and all the way that you can see in the same way .
so , i can turn into this point in my life in a particular zeitrahmen .
here is the stand of the whole demonstration that i 've been doing here .
and i can all be able to look at what i 'm doing now , again , zurückholen .
and , if i take a step back , and i 'll look at it all , i think , i can see my verlauf , i 'm going to go back to my such-vergangenheit . here , i went to nach for the nach , and here 's
and from that , i can go into the side and see it again .
it 's a metaphor that 's used to get it back , and every time it 's going to do that much bigger than bigger than the amount of datenteile .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a fluch .
we 're talking about the fluch of the informationsüberflusses .
we talk about the ertrinken in information .
what if we could look at the situation and the internet to the internet so that instead of people , i would still start to get away from one to the other things , and so , from some ways that we can go to a lot of stuff
if we can do this , this is datenfalle , and maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of only just going to move into information , we can get knowledge .
and if we know knowledge , we may even have to daraus it .
that 's what i 'm hearing about , thank you very much .
i grew up with a gehörigen portion science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus , i went back to the beach every day every day .
and i 've always been on a book , and i 'm thinking about a science-fiction-buch that einem , who is to think of my other worlds in the worlds , and in the erzählerische process , i 'm going to be close to me as a unersättliche neugier
and they just turned out that even though i was n't in school , when i was n't in school , i would go to the forests , and i would have to go and say , `` sammelte '' and proben , and they were schlangen , and
i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world , and the limits of the world .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be widerzuspiegeln in my environment because , in the late '60s , we would go to the moon and erforschten the deep .
jacques cousteau came in to our sendungen shows that animals and animals and all of a world of wonder showed that they never had ever seen before .
that 's what it seems like to be gut to the gepasst .
and i was artists .
i was able to draw . i could paint paint .
and there was n't no video games to put in the mit of the mit that had done all of the bildsprache in the landscape , i had to create the images in my mind .
we had to do it in the first time . if we read a book and we met a book , we took the beschreibung of the autors and we put it on the screen in our heads .
my response was to come up with the war , , , creative worlds , and robotern and whatever .
in the matheunterricht , i was erwischt by my teacher , as i was , lehrbuch lehrbuch 's versteckt .
they had to get some of them .
and that was interesting . this was what a really interesting story about how sendungen nämlich sendungen was that one of the most important world we had in the world to be a virtual world .
certainly , i would never get an außerirdische world with a raumschiff , which was that i was pretty surprised .
but here was a world that i could actually be here on the earth , and it was also fascinating and fascinating and wie , all of my thinking that i thought i 'd read when i read these books .
so i decided to be 15 , to be taucher .
the only problem was that i was living in a small village in canada , about 100,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i did n't get it out .
i nervte my father , until finally , i was eine a tauchschule in new york , new york , who had to be on the other side of the border , where we were .
i was doing my tauchschein in a pool of the mitten in the middle of the hospital in the hospital in buffalo , in new york .
but the ocean is the real ocean , and it 's got two years later , i 've got to see two years ago , and we moved to california .
since then , in 40 years , die are now , i 've spent about three million hours of water , 500 hours of them .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep self itself in the ocean ocean itself , in the oceans , are living in the ozeanen , as we are at the very kaum of it .
the nature of nature knows that we do n't know the boundaries , by the way to our own , kläglichen human well-being .
and for the days of days , i feel like myself to be a more of the ehrfurcht of what i see in my tauchgängen .
and my love to the ocean is mit with the same kind of eh and the ones .
when i was a erwachsener , when i was a teenager , i was beruf .
that seemed to be the best way to make my inner drang , to share stories that i have to create , to create images .
as a child , i was comicbücher comicbücher .
so movies are all the way , images and images , and all the geschichten .
of course , the stories that i was talking about was science-fiction-bereich , `` aliens , '' `` nigeria , '' `` `` '' . ''
in abyss , i was able to make my vorliebe for the unterwasserwelt and the tauchen with the filmemachen .
so my verflochten is my two .
something interesting happened to `` abyss '' : to solve a erzählerisches problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of flüssiges wasserwesen -- we did on auf animation , cg , back .
what happened was that the first computergenerierte soft-surface-figur , which was ever in the first place in the movie .
the film was not going to be a lot of money , and he said that if he played , he was spielte again , but i realized something a little fascinating : the audience on the whole world was like me from the magic that was coming from
according to clarke , law is about bekanntlich technologies and zauberei zauberei nicht .
so they saw a magic .
and that 's what i found really exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that has to be done in filmkunst . ''
so we went to `` 2 2 , '' the next movie , which is another .
together with ilm , we created the guy from flüssigem metall . success , it was hing , as it would change .
and it worked . and we had a little bit of paper . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have a little bit more money to do it .
in this individual experience , i was erreicht a whole new world , a very new world of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend stan winston , who was the best make-up- and creature-designer . she was called `` digital domain . ''
and the idea of this company was the die of prozesse prozesse with optischen etc and gleich and überspringen with gleich digital produktionen .
so we did that , and we taten ourselves a little so .
but in the early years , we realized that we were in creature- and und -- which we actually did have been -- as to langsam vorankamen .
i was written this piece of `` '' , '' which die the messlatte in all of the effects of things , in the menschlichen of all of the höhen at all of the human menschlichen , ausdrucksvollen characters , who have been made by cg . and should
but the messlatte drückte were pretty well , and the people in my company told me that we ca n't be able to be able to create the deal .
and so i did this and i put this other film over the big ship , which was . .
the filmstudio i went from als verkauft and julia on a ship . it was a liebesfilm epischen , , a film .
but in fact , i wanted to really zum the actual real der .
this is how i did the film .
that 's the truth . the studio did n't know .
but i realized that , i said , `` we 're going to go to the wrack . we 're doing the real wrack .
we 're going to show it in the eröffnungssequenz of the movie .
that 's pretty important . it 's a good aufhänger for marketing . ''
and i überredete them to make an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to the point of your own imagination .
we actually started six months later , a course , a der tauchboot , four miles under the surface of the lake , and the real world 's filled by a bullauge anschaute .
this was not a film , no hd , which was real .
so that 's really what i 'm doing .
and the vorbereitungen were enormous . and we had to get cameras and scheinwerfer and make them possible .
and i felt like this tiefseetauchgänge , a einer . .
well , they were also hochtechnisch and bedurften planung .
you get into this steigt , and you 're going to be in the dark , where you 're in the dark , where you do hope is not where hope is not to live .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's the same thing as if i 'm in a science-fiction-film .
that 's really cool . ''
and i was obsessed with the tiefsee of the deep sea .
anyway , part of the things that work with curiosity and science . it was all that was . it was , it was curiosity . it was es .
and it was a experience that could not be dancing .
because , you know , i was able to be able to be able to imagine myself , that we could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i could see outside of the fensters .
in a couple of the expeditionen i 've seen in nature , and things that i 've never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before anyone , and for the moment of science , when we saw them , even though they had
so that 's what mich me was , and i wanted to do it .
and then i met some crazy decision .
after the success of `` vagina '' said , `` i 'm okay , `` okay , i mean , i want to call my hauptberuf filmemacher as a in in hollywood , and i 'm going to vollzeit-forscher for a while . ''
and then we started , we came to `` bismarck , '' and erforschten them with roboterfahrzeugen .
we kehrten back to the titanic .
we took little robots which we built , which was a fiberglaskabel abwickelten .
our intent has been hineinzutauchen and sich the inside of the schiffs , which never had done before .
nobody had ever had the inside of the . . she did n't have any means for it . so we developed the technology .
well , i 'm sitting there in the der of the neighborhood , in a tauchboot , and see planken that diesen this kind of stuff like this , and i know that once the hat was there .
and i 'm going to go through a little bit of roboterfahrzeug with the gänge of the schiffs .
but i 'm actually just doing this , but i think this is the inside of the fahrzeugs .
it felt like i was growing in the schiffswracks of the titanic .
this was the surrealste form form of a déjà-vu that i ever learned , because before i was sitting in a corner , i always had to know what i 'd been doing in the lichtkegel of the fahrzeugs des , because i was going
so the company was a genaue kopie of the baupläne of the . .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me this dieses , that you could use such roboterhafte avatare and so und your own sense of consciousness .
it was really ungeheuer .
and maybe there 's a little bit of activity on the way that might possibly happen in a few decades , if you have , cyborg-körper to make a new or other things , in all kinds of post-humanen of die that i can consider as a science-fiction-fan .
after that expeditionen , we started looking at what we saw , really , to learn , to look at this tiefseequellen , for example of these beispiel verblüffenden , where we saw this incredibly verblüffenden animals , and that 's außerirdische , but here on the ground .
they live live with them .
they 're not in a auf of system , so we do that .
and so you can see animals that are directly directly to a 500 degree of ants that they can survive .
so , at the same time , i 've been very interested in public , which is the science-fiction-einfluss of my childhood .
and so i ended up to people who are interested in space and doing the line of the institution , and the nasa and the und , and the richtige , and the sie , the sie , they 're going to go through russia , through the mission
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was going to go out , i was going to go out to the deep ocean .
i took them and mit ihnen them on the world right there , astrobiologen , planetenwissenschaftler , people who were interested in these situations , and i took them to the quellen , so they move to the quellen , and they
we used to dokumentarfilme , but in fact , we did , in fact , science , really , was weltraumwissenschaft .
so the circle between the circle of my existence as a science-fiction-fan , then a child , and the umsetzung in the reality .
over the course of that habe , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot of science about this , but i 'm thinking , i 'm sure , you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a leader , like a schiffskapitän or something .
but i do n't understand much of the end before i have this expeditionen .
because at one point , i had to say , `` what am i doing here ?
why do i do it ? what 's going to do ? ''
these blöden movies are not going to take us money .
we 're just going to look at the produktionskosten . we do n't get out of the ruhm .
all of a sudden i 'm talking about `` titanic '' and `` avatar '' and `` avatar '' and i would have irgendwo the nägel on a auf on the beach .
i have all of these films , this dokumentarfilme , for a very small audience .
do n't get keine , like no , no , no money , whatever are you doing ?
you 're going to do it in the end of your job , and the challenge is , and the ocean is the herausforderndste environment that you have , and you take it to the wegen , and because of this sense of
because we 've done all this with 10 to 12 people who have been doing ununterbrochen for a year , sometimes sometimes we have two or four months in the lake .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is the lack of achtung that you have a single person to do , because you have a task to do one of the other things that you ca n't possibly say .
if you go to the country , you say , `` we had to do it , the fiberglas , the schallschwächung , and the whole thing that technik technology , and the problem of human leistungsvermögen , if you 're going to go
there 's a connection , a gegenseitiger , a respekt .
so when i was coming to my next film , i would say , `` i 'm going to be able to use the same führungsstil , '' which is that you can get your team , and you 're in the dessen of it .
and then , the really changed the dynamic .
so that 's when i was mit with a little team of unbekanntem . , and we drehten `` avatar '' with a new technology that we did n't have .
pretty exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we 've become a richtigen family for a few family .
and it was my way to make films , completely movies .
there were people who said , we would have made a lot of und on the planet .
for me , there was more of a prinzipielle way to do my job , which is a process that changed the result .
so what can we do from all of that ?
so what do we learn from ?
i think that 's the first curiosity of curiosity .
it 's the most human human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the achtung of their team is more important than the lorbeer of the world .
to me , there 's a filmemacher who says , `` give me a advice for me to do something like that . ''
and i say , `` well , do n't touch itself .
this is what happens in your hand . it does n't tell you , but it does n't tell you , it 's not about your own self . it takes risks to you .
nasa 's got a lieblingssatz , `` it 's not an option .
but in the art and in the art , there must be a alternative , because there is a vertrauensvorschuss .
not an important , innovation , innovation , who has no longer risiko .
you have to be willing to take the risks on the way .
this is the idea that i want to give you a little bit easier to yourself , but it 's an alternative , it 's not an option , and it 's not . thank you .
today , i talk about you about power and energy .
and this is something that seems to me , because my vollzeitbeschäftigung bei at the foundation is now impfstoffe and impfstoffe , and the things that we have to do , and have to have to give the two two billion dollars a better scale .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , but actually , more important for any other than the other .
klimaverschlechterung means that the saaten saaten are not going to grow in a lot of years , and they 're too much to do too much . they do things that they can not be able to aushalten .
this leads to hungersterben . it 's going to be unsicherheit . it 's unruhen .
so , you know , is going to be a terrible terrible for you .
and also , it 's a very important thing to do .
the fact is that if you could only reduce the price of the cost , it would be energy in the energy , it would be a lot of energy in the weitem .
well , the energiepreis is much of the time .
in fact , the fortschrittsgesellschaft of auf is on energiefortschritten .
and the trieb , the industrial revolution , and the im century , was a rapiden case in the elektrizitätspreis , and that 's why rapiden , kühlschränke , we have kühlschränke , and we have modern materials , we can do modern materials and so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with power in the world .
but , if we get the price increase -- let 's take the price for us -- let 's take a new paradigm , and we 're going to put it on a new basis .
co2 is the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they summieren the ausgestoßene co2 that welches to zur , and they temperaturerhöhung the temperaturerhöhung . they have negative , and they 're worse , and they do n't realize that the movements that seem to be able to be able to be able to anpassen and veränderungen the
now , the wonderful connection between a co2-anstieg and the dadurch dadurch and where the other things are there , there are some unklarheiten , but not many .
and there 's certainly unklarheit of how good these are going to be . but they 're going to be extremely bad .
i asked the top-wissenschaftler couple , `` well , we have to come down to zero zero ?
is n't it ever half or two or a half ? ''
the answer is , until we go close to zero , we 're going to keep going down .
that 's why it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than saying , we have a 3,5 m high school who has to be under one meter of the surface .
that 's got to be down , down to zero .
well , we went out a lot of kohlenstoffdioxid every year , over seven billion billion miles .
every americans , about 20 tons of people -- poor people , poor people .
on average , there 's about five tons of every single thing on the planet .
and somehow we need to make change that we have to do that to zero .
it 's been konstant .
only different economic changes have been used to all , and we need to go from rapidem to reduce us to a verringerung to zero .
this equation has four factors . it 's a little bit of multiplikation . you 've got this thing on the left -- co2 -- that 's going to take zero to zero , and that is going to reduce the number of people , the average energy
so let 's look at any risk here , and we want to see how we get that zero .
probably one of them is very close to zero .
now this is really profound , but we 're going to do it again .
we first got the population population .
today , 6,8 billion people .
and it goes to billions of billions of year -- to move to 9 billion .
if we were very successful at the impfstoffen of der , the gesundheitsvorsorgung and the sind , we might be able to do it because of 10 percent or 15 percent , but at the time , we 're going to have a steigung to 25 .
second , the second is not the die that we use .
it 's all about food that we eat food , clothing , television , heizung .
these are very good stuff and armutsverringerung to make that dienste fast on every planet .
it 's great that this number up .
in the rich world , in the billion billion , we could be able to make abstriche and less less , but in the average , there is a number of 10 percent per year , and it 's more likely to be insgesamt percent , and it 's
so what we 're looking at here is a really fundamental tool . is it at home , so you can read the homework ?
and this is not what they did n't , and they schüler , and they like to look at them like their straßenlicht .
now , with efficiency , the e , the energy per capita , there 's all good news .
we have something that does n't go .
because of all of a sudden , in a lot of different success in the lichtsektor , from other autotypen , through new kinds of methoden , in our new ways , with the häuserbau , there 's a lot of money that energieaufwand some individual services
in other diensten , like herstellung and , , -- 105 00:05:56,000 , > 00:05:58,000 , or 00:05:58,000 luftverkehr , or ist , , it 's a little bit of small für .
in all , if we 're optimistic , we might be a reduzierung , a little one or two , a long six .
but with the first three factors , we now have been 26 by billions of thousands of thousands of times und .
so let 's see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a schlüsselfaktor -- this is the amount of co2 that is pro per energieeinheit .
it 's the question of why we can get this out of zero .
if you go to coal , it 's kohle .
when they get natural gas , no .
almost every herstellungsmethode of the world 's electricity are co2 , but the bees are energien .
so what we need to do is a big level , is to create a system that is a system .
we need energiewunder .
now , if i do n't use the term `` wonders , '' i do n't mean the impossible .
the mikroprozessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
and the internet and the dienste is a miracle .
people have here in the development of many of these miracles .
in fact , there is no deadline , there is no wonder as well as a scientist .
usually you 're just going to go back and say some other things .
but in this case , we need to be able to be a vollgas and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really do this ?
is there a natural illustration , a mission that has the idea of people who 's here in this ?
i remember my last year when i was when i was lost , and i felt like this people .
and the idea was to really be able to do this , and you know that there are people who live with autism .
and for that , i was going to make it this .
and i decided that the freilassen of my life was going to be my beitrag .
so here are some of the glühwürmchen .
you know , you know , it 's been told me that you 're not beißen . you 're not going to leave the glass .
well , there 's all kinds of spielereilösungen of these things , but they do n't get much much .
we need solutions ; solutions , or one that gives you a huge amount of scale and unvorstellbare verlässlichkeit , and even though there are many of the people that i think of the people that i have to do
i have gezeiten , , , , and biokraftstoffe .
this may may be a moderaten beitrag , and if you have a better amount of weight , i would say that , well , my favorite thing here is that we have to deal with all of these things , and we ca n't give us
let 's first step at first time , verbrennen , first of the fossil fuels , from verbrennung , coal .
what you have to do here is perhaps just , but it 's not . you do n't . you should all get the co2 co2 from the bottom of the schornstein , the , , and then to go
there are some pilotprojekte that you can do about a 60 percent -- 80 percent of the world , but it is about 100 to 50 percent , and it 's going to be a very hard , and it 's got to be a challenge of the größte
who 's going to do it ?
who can make a difference , which is a lot of billions of greater greater than any kind of müll that you can imagine from nuklear- and other things ?
that 's a lot of carbon .
so this is a hard nuss .
next thing , nuklearenergie .
it also has three three problems . the cost , especially in hochregulierten countries are high , so the question is to be sure that you can really have nothing to be able to do , despite the human being , that it 's not used for weapons ,
and what do you do with it ?
because even though he does n't have big , there is a lot of time .
so three , three problems , which may be a little bit more and more and more important .
the last three of the five ones i did .
it 's the erneuerbaren that it is genannt .
and also , even though -- it 's great , it does n't have to have -- you 're going to have a government -- you have some options .
one is the energiedichte , which is the technologies that are diese , creating these technologies .
this is energiefarmen , you 're talking about a lot of tausendmal , tausendmal more than a normal power .
and then , they were unterliegen to these unterbrechungen .
the sun seems to be the day , it does n't seem to be every day , and it 's not wind by the wind .
and so you have to remember , if you 're abhängig about these von , you 've got a way to get energy , even though you 're not available .
so there 's big preisherausforderungen there , there are challenges that we have to do , because of course , for example , that we have the energiequelle outside the country , they do n't need to be just the only way they do it , they have to
and there 's the lagerungsproblem .
and to show the scale , i have all kinds of things that are being built : the ones that cars , computers , cell phones , taschenlampen , für , all the time . the amount of the energy energy , and i
so we need a big großen , a little bit of a little bit better than a herangehensweisen will be higher than the herangehensweisen to go to time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
that happens , if you try to get unterbrochenen down , you know , 20 percent of the year we 'll be 30 percent 30 percent .
if you want to study 100 percent percent to focus on it , you have an wunderbatterie unglaubliche .
now , where we 're going to go , what is the right approach ?
a manhattan project , how do we get the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies who are working on it .
we 're at least in every single bereiche at every single population .
and so , you 're going to say to say , you 're crazy ! that 's crazy .
i think there 's a lot of the ted group here in many that there is many .
bill is a number of companies , under different one called esolar die großartige .
vinod khosla invest in hundreds of companies doing the big things and have interesting opportunities , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i 'm making a company that is , of course , a great way to get a nuklearen approach .
there are some innovation in nuklearbereich ; they are modular .
development has taken in this industry before a long time ago , so it 's not a big surprise to make good good concepts .
the idea is that you take instead of the teils part of the urans that is one percent , the entschieden , we decided to verbrennen the 99 percent , the u238 .
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've had a long time , but i 've never been able to be able to predict whether it would work , but since the modern supercomputer is it , you can see it , and see it , yes , yes , with
and because of that , you get this 99 percent , it 's a lot better .
in fact , you 're going to increase in the production , and you can even use the waste of today that are using benutzen .
instead of going to go to verbrennen the kopf , it just einfach it . a great thing .
it 's going to verbraucht , it 's verbraucht , a little bit of a . .
you can see that it 's a sort of light that 's often as much as a wandernde wave device .
and really , this is what the löst . is .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the abfall , the co2 percent , it 's the part of this verbrannt today , it 's called uran uran .
the triebe of the united states of hundreds of years .
and if you 're günstig günstig and einfach , you 're enough to buy enough for the rest of your planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges there , but it 's an example of many hundreds of ideas we need to get around .
let 's think about what we should measure .
how about our zeugnis look ?
well , let 's go to the target that we need to achieve , and then talk to the zwischenschritt .
a lot of them is 80 percent percent .
it 's really very important to get there .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries , and still a total , hopefully getting going to be sauber and be up to be on the way .
so , to reduce the 80 percent , the world , the population , including countries like china , their elektrizitätsgeneration completely umstellen .
the third thing says , whether we use the null-emissionen technology , whether it 's in the developed countries , in the developed countries , and we 're on the way to get it out on the same .
that 's great .
this will be a schlüsselelement schlüsselelement .
if we were back there , what should we do about the disease ?
it should have been the same elements .
we should use the effektivitätsmaßnahmen to make the reduktion , to the extent we have , the less wir we , the will become the co2-summe , and the temperature will be the co2-summe .
but in fact , this is the message for the things that we 're doing , which are not completely close to the whole reduktionen , just the same , even even less , and something less important than the other people who have the schnelligkeit of innovation in
and we 're going to have to do with vollgas , and we can measure that : in firmenzahlen , in pilotprojekten , in .
there are lots of great books in this topic .
the al gore book , `` we have the choice . '' david david without `` the the .
they really do it , and they create a mechanism that is going to be very close to this , because we need a support of everybody .
there 's a couple of things that come up .
this is a wish .
a very hard thing , we know , this is this technology .
if you 're only going to give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a impfstoff , and i love , or maybe i wish that wish , i 'd say that the halbierter , is not going
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get that wish , the graben between the long and kurzfristig people will be very bad , the u.s. and china , and the rest of the two billion , and almost every single day , of the two billion
so , what do we need to do ?
so , what were the appelliere ?
we have to use more forschungsgelder .
if countries are in places like wie , they do n't just talk about carbon .
they should be diese this , and they would be used to the lächerlich low geldern that they could do for their personal herangehensweisen .
we need marktanreize , co2 , cap & amp ; we do a dass .
we have to spread the message .
we have to create dialog and vollständiger und , and the things that make things come from the government .
it 's a very hard thing , but i think we can get it out .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to try to understand a little bit , you know , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation in a supercomputer , a number of scientists that we 've done , we only need some of 10 million , and even if we have our materials in a competition , we make sure that it 's 100en , and it
the hard idea is to build the first reaktors to see more billion , the billions of the und and the der of the same thing .
once the first finished , if you look like it , like , it 's all about clear , because it 's the energiedichte , the wirtschaftlichkeit , the energiedichte is so different than we know .
to understand this : this means deep to the ground almost as literally as a vertikale look of a vertikale , like this , like this , like und , the process of the process , and then the beginning of the process is , where does it go
bg : exactly . today , today , you have to go through the process for about befüllen , so there 's a lot of people in there , and there 's lots of people who can go back to that , and that 's where you 're going
but if you have a sehr brennstoff , you can befüllen it for 60 years -- think about a säule -- it 's vergraben , you know , the whole komplexitäten .
and it 's there , it 's about 60 years , and it 's done there .
a nuklearreaktor , even , is a solution for the müll .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the food is : you can put it out there -- there 's a lot less with that kind of stuff -- then you take it and put it in the next one and
and we begin , by looking at the food that we already have , which is already in the der or trockenbehältern of reaktoren . it is our startbrennstoff .
so this is what 's this problem , which is a problem , which is what we 're going to do , and it 's going to spread all the way that we 've done the müllvolumen of europe .
but while you were talking about the different people in the world 's way .
where is the biggest interest of what it really do ?
bg : now we have n't got a lot of a festgelegt , and there 's a lot of interesting offenlegungsregeln for everything that is nuklear in the name . there are big interest , and the people of the company was in russia , india , china --
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done in the direction .
this is a selection of a thing that was done .
this is a real step , but it 's like a faster , a bunch of galaxies , and these countries have built this , so that everybody is able to do a schnellen , a first .
in their idea , `` how do you really make a living in life ?
bg : now , we need one of these skalierbaren , things that are very cheap , we have to grow up for 20 years and 20 years to build 20 years .
this is the deadline deadline that we have given us that we 've got to be einhalten .
and you know , terrapower , if everything goes wrong , and that 's a big wish to do that .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need the ones that are , as the way , when they work , for example , for example .
and it would be the best thing to do when it creates several dimensions , and then you could use a mischung .
in fact , we need a solution .
betreffend of this kind of exercise is the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the allerwichtigste .
that would also have been the case in the umweltherausforderung , but it does n't make it much more important .
in the national , there are other leaders in organizations .
you know , we do n't know the work of all this kind of thing that this is , but there 's the modulare method , that 's a new idea .
there 's a flüssigen reaktortyp , which seems to be a little bit better , but maybe it tells us about us .
and so there 's different , but the beautiful thing about this is that a hundred million times a lot of energy has been a lot of energy like a , we 're going to have an idea , and so if you can deal with the problems ,
if that does n't work , then what ?
do we have to einleiten notfallmaßnahmen , to try to get the stabil of stabil ?
bg : if you come to that situation , it 's like if you 've gone out a lot , and it 's a herzinfarkt , you know , and it 's a vor .
there is a forschungsrichtung die called nennt , which is befasst with various techniques to help the warming , so that , 20 to 20 years , will bekämen us .
it 's just a versicherungsmethode .
you hope that you do n't need that .
some people say , you should n't just want to work at the same because you might have a little bit better because you might think of it , you know , you know , that 's going to get the die .
i do n't know if it 's smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but it 's a diskurs in geoengineering about whether you should have it , if it 's faster , or this innovation needs to be more
klimaskeptiker : did you have a robot or two to the um , to you , to you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the life is skeptiker in very different camps .
those who do the argumente are , very little .
tell that there 's negative effects that do with those who have done things ?
there 's very , very , very few things you can tell you , from which there is a chance in a million .
the hauptproblem here is like this is aids .
you make it mistakes , and you make a lot of it later .
and therefore , the idea is now , if you 've got all sorts of problems of problems in something that are used to invest in something that 's been on the other side , and that is that the risk of investition is not clear . it 's
the fact is that this is going to be unsicherheit to us .
but my dream here is that if you can use it , if you can grow co2 , it 's the co2 , and the skeptiker is going to say , `` here 's the skeptiker , `` okay , i do n't really know that it 's not
and that would be your answer to the björn lomborg system , that if you use all these time and energy to solve the growth problem , all the other aspects of oil , in the suffering , the die , the bekämpfung of the
bg : well , the actual ausgaben for the research -- we 're going to get 10 to 10 billion dollars a year , when we do more -- it 's not like that .
there was no leiden at all .
you get too big and und können , and here you can do a lot of people , if you have something that 's not sustainable , and trying to use it . for example , most of the solar system .
because it 's very , very kurz , and it 's a vor , and it 's a little bit , and it 's a little bit more , and i think i think we 're going to be more things better than the opportunity to be very strong
if you have a man , you know , that 's high , you know , that 's a very high können , you can just do the same thing .
i mean , every one of us here may be one more time for five times a lot of our own without having a seinen .
for the second two billion , it 's a desaster .
and even lomborg thinking .
his new masche is now : `` why do n't we get more of our research ? ''
he 's still going to be there , because of stories , stories of the skeptiker-camp stories , but he understood that this is a very einsame group group , and so he 's going to get the forschungsargument .
and this is a gedankengang that i think about angemessen .
the research , it 's easy to get the little bit wenig .
bill , i think i 'm going to speak all of you here , almost as i say , i do hope that i do n't hope you should want to be a lot . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , ted at ted , named peter skillman einen einen design-wettbewerb , `` the marshmallow-herausforderung . ''
the idea is pretty simple . vierer-teams has to größtmögliche the größtmögliche of structure with 20 spaghetti , but with klebeband , about ca , about ca and one .
the soldier has to be on the left .
and even though , it 's easy , it 's actually quite hard , because it 's been trying to get people very quickly .
and so i thought this was a interesting idea , and i found it in a design-workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i 've been talking about 70 percent worldwide worldwide , with the students , the students , and even even the ctos of the fortune-50-unternehmen , and there 's something about this task that is very tiefe in the nature of collaboration , and i want
usually , most people think about people are bezüglich themselves .
they talk about it , they think , how it 's going to look at what it 's going to look like .
and then they spend a lot of time in planning and organization . they skizzieren and they spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the zusammenbau all over the zusammenbau .
and finally , before they did n't have time anymore , they would get the front , and they put them on top of it , and they put them back to the top , they come back to a ta-da .
but then , always , something that means `` ta-da , '' is that `` ta-da , '' because the weight of the marshmallows , the die of the marshmallows , that the whole thing is verbiegt and einstürzt .
there are a number of people who are much more uh-oh uh-oh than others , and they have a lot of bwl-absolventen bwl-absolventen .
they lie , they 're verwirrt , they 're confused and they 're actually really dürftige .
and of course , there 's also been the die of viel -gebilde , and the best are frische of the kindergartens .
and that 's pretty amazing .
as we call peter smith , they did n't just use the highest , but also the strukturen structures of everyone .
so you 're going to be coming out , what 's the point ? why is it ? what is what ?
and he says , `` none of the kids are going to be living in the investiert of the spaghetti . ''
they do n't invest in . .
but there 's another reason .
and that is that bwl-studenten have been trained to find a real plan . ''
and then he immediately .
so what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have no more time , what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what kindergartenkinder does is that they 're starting to get to get out of their building and build building prototypes , and we 've done a little bit of the building on the top , so that they have the opportunity to have taken us .
konstrukteure is erkennen these kinds of collaboration as a kern of iterativen .
and with some attempt , the children will be unmittelbar by feedback , which is work , and not .
that 's how we 're working with planning , with -- but we can , but once again , how different use the model .
the average of the big things is about 50cm , and it 's about half of them , some more , but much more , more and more than adults .
who 's the most important ?
architects and engineers , to happiness .
1m is the highest i 've ever seen .
and why ? because they 're also able to use patterns of sich-selbst-verstärkende patterns , and the patterns are the key to build the structures .
ceos are something about average . but here 's going to be interesting .
you put a exekutive administrator on the team , you get much better .
it 's unbelievable . it 's looking at it and you can see , and this is a team .
you can predict the question . why is that ?
because they have special skills of prozessbegleitung .
they leiten the process , they understand it .
and the team , the regelt and the auf , is going to improve the signifikant of the team of the team of the team of this .
spezialisierte skills and prozessfähigkeiten and prozessfähigkeiten and lead to their combination .
if you have 10 employees that you look at the same time , you 'll get six , you have to build six structures .
so i tried to spannendes something a little bit .
i thought , let 's have a pokereinsatz look .
and so i took a einen dollars to open software for the gewinner .
what if you think about this design-studenten ?
what was the result ?
that was done , not a team had an stabile structure .
if anybody had a 2,5cm high development , he would have won the price home .
so is n't it interesting , high school high , have a huge effect ?
we wiederholten these practice with the students .
what do they think ?
now , he 's the advantage of prototyping .
so , in the same way , there was a great one in the best .
they were the same kind of time of the same kind of time .
so there 's somit lessons that we 've been talking about in terms of power and success .
they like to ask , why would someone actually grow a investieren in a time ?
the reason is , i 'm digital digital tools and process to create and create , to replace cars , cars , video games and `` visual effects . ''
and what the marshmallow-challenge is doing , you can help them versteckte you .
because open up every year , every project has its home .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language or a common language or a grundhaltung , grundhaltung bzw .
and this is the value of this experience , that is simple .
and those of you who are interested in here can be marshmallowchallenge.com .
it 's a blog where you see how you see the marshmallows .
there 's a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
you find crazy examples of all the world around the people and optimieren them .
there are also weltrekorde .
and the basale lesson , i think , is really the inside of a konstruktion .
it allows us to make our sense of the same thing , and we 're using our thinking of thinking about how we feel and how to do , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes a small small team of this experience is everything that it needs to come from us from a `` - '' to be a ta-da . ''
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so , we do that as if we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , a machine , and that 's a zeitmaschine .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you ca n't be here in the way , and you can not be here .
and i wonder what you would say , because i have been asking a lot of time for a lot of time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars , or twitter or twitter , the american america .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you 're sort of hingezogen to nostalgie .
and that 's what i see .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to live in the past , and it 's because i 'm a abenteurer .
it 's because there 's not a lot of the world that we do n't get back to the planet .
so , i want to put it into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most exciting time that there was ever on the planet , no matter where it 's like : health , wealth , healthy , , gelegenheiten .
there was never a time before this .
my ur-großeltern died every single than she was 60 .
my großeltern drängten are this number of 70 .
my parents are the 80 of the fersen .
so there should be a little bit at the beginning of my todeszahl .
but it does n't come to people like us , because it 's a bigger thing than that .
now , this is a child that 's been born in today , this is trying to live as long as the fifth man in the world .
think about it . that 's an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox smallpox : smallpox has billions of billions of people on this planet .
you have the weight of the earth on a way to geformt on the way that the ever has ever done .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have it bezwungen .
in the rich world , there are diseases that have millions of thousands of us just about 20 percent , even less .
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
do anybody even know what this is ?
impfstoffe , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people -- are the great way of the collective .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and figure out , things like it , if it works , it does change it . it does n't change one of the great großartigsten of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , it 's the news , because there are a couple of other things , and there are a few other things , and they 've been very often .
and one of them is that , despite all of our time , a billion people , one in the day , they 're spending a billion people on the ground every day .
this number is up , and it 's very quickly very quickly , and it 's beschämend .
and not only that , we used to have an idea of being vorstellungskraft into this world .
drinking water , urbares country , singapore , oil , gas : it 's gone , and it 's just going to be , and if we 're not going to get us out of this chaos , we 're also verschwinden .
so the question is : can we do it ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can make food food , which is nine people , people will save the people who are ernähren without the country that they 're alive to .
i think that we can make this world with energy , which is not going to use it .
i do n't think that 's , and no , it 's not like wunschdenken .
but this is what i 've come up at night , one of the things that i 'm wach at night . we 've still lived science in the way that we 've never been as far before .
and we 've also never yet to ihn it , of course , to ihn it .
we 're at the end of a wonderful event , and this is a lot of things that are really well , and yet , i think we 're going to have hundreds of 300 years before the aufklärung to come up to find a time of
people hüllen themselves in their faith , and they 're so eng that they ca n't be befreien .
not only the truth will be befreien .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a real thing to do is the progress .
but you know , if you do n't know , you 're not exactly right ?
they do n't have the right thing to their facts . 'tschuldigung , they do n't .
and i took a while to figure out this .
about a decade ago , i had a article written about a new york magazine , a little article .
and i was amazed to be a resistance , which was the gegenüber of the effektivste was of health care of the human health issue .
i did n't know what to do , so i did n't just know what i was doing , and i wrote a paper and went on .
and soon , i wrote a article on artikel change .
the same thing , just bigger .
people would go crazy .
so i also wrote a paper article , and i could n't understand why people thought it would be a frankenfood , but why they thought that if they thought they were at a certain level of a situation like a zufällige species , it was an übergriff
but you know , i 'm going to do that . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we 're going to be rich , we 're eating , we 're eating , we 're okay .
but these articles made me , and i could n't figure out why , and then finally , i found out .
and that 's because these fanatiker that did n't make me verrückt verrückt .
these were umsichtige people , gebildete people , anständige people .
they were exactly what people in this room .
and that led me to me .
but then i thought , you know what , let 's be honest .
we 're at one point , where we do n't have the same relationship with progress , like everything .
we 're talking about this .
we 're talking about it , with little things , with little anführungszeichen , and that 's progress .
okay , so there 's reasons why there is a reason , and i think we know what reasons they are .
we have the trust in the institutions , in arabic , and sometimes in the science of it , and there is no reason why it should not be like this .
you can just say a little name , and people will understand .
tschernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , massenvernichtungswaffen , the us-präsidentschaftswahl 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we believed they were always right . they 're pretty skeptisch .
so , ask yourself , you need evidence to take us .
do n't have that .
but here 's the point : if you 've got the evidence that evidence , you have to be a little bit , and it 's not very good .
and i can tell you that we are now in a epidemic of the epidemic of fear , as i never never saw , and hopefully never will never go again .
about 12 years ago , a story happened published a story about a story that die the die to the masern , mumps , and röteln impfstoff in .
very furchteinflößend .
haufenweise studies have been used to see if it 's true .
haufenweise studies should be done ; it 's a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came out of the united states from the united states , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no verbindung , no one .
it does no difference . it does n't make a difference because we think of anekdoten , we think we can see what we 're seeing , what we 're feeling to feel .
we do n't believe we have a conversation in the dokumente of the planet , there 's data , and i understand that , i think that 's all we 're going to do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was katastrophal .
because of course , because the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impfrate für impfrate .
this is skandalös , and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that .
because did anyone masern ?
is there a single person in the audience ever heard of masern ?
it 's not very often happening .
in this country , it 's country not at all , but it 's 160.000 years ago .
that 's a lot of death from masern , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not what we 're going to try and do it is , it 's verdrängen , and people like jenny mccarthy can herumlaufen , and from fear of the time and plattformen botschaften to larry , like larry and b king live
and you can do it because you do n't have the cause and korrelation .
they do n't understand that these things are going to be just the same way , but they 're never the same .
and that is something that we need to learn from , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he befreite us from one of the worst geißeln of humanity .
not fear , fear , puff , puff .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he 's called paul offit .
he 's been building a few people on a anderen .
he can leben the lives of 400- , 500.000 children per year in developing countries .
pretty good , not ?
well , this is good , except for paul say , `` paul spricht and talk about , '' and how it 's because they 're just getting to be jammern .
and that 's what he does .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks in a public anhörung system , he ca n't aussagen any aussagen .
he gets anrufe by saying , because people like to tell him , to know , to know , to know where to know where to children with their children .
and why ? because paul has a impfstoff .
i do n't need to say that , but we 're impfstoffe .
you take it to the kehren , the diseases of terrible , terrible , and that 's what happens .
we have now in this country now .
and it 's getting worse , and soon soon children will get back to it , because that 's just one question .
and they 're not going to die from masern .
what about kinderlähmung ? let 's take that . why not ?
a kommilitonin of mine told me a few weeks ago , and i thought i 'd be a little too schrill .
nobody would have said that .
she would n't give her child to kinderlähmung impfen . no one .
fein .
why ? because we do n't have kinderlähmung , and do you know what ?
we had no wir in this country .
now , i do n't know , maybe i 'm going to be lagos in the morning today , and i 'm going to go back to los angeles , right now , at the moment , it 's in ohio .
and in a few hours , he landet and a car , and he 's going to go through the beach , and he 's going to be one of the fantastichen ted-dinner ted-dinner today .
and he does n't know that he 's used to be a lähmenden disease , and we do n't know that , because that 's how it 's going to go .
that 's the planet that we live in . they do n't do it as if it 's not .
we love to hüllen ourselves . we love that .
have you all been morgen out all the morning ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium , that helps you to sprünge .
i know you 've done that because half the americans do that every day is going to make every day .
they take the stuff , and they 'll take an alternative value , and it does n't make any difference how often we find out that they are nutzlos .
that 's what we 're doing .
they verdunkeln their own . they do n't do it .
that 's okay , you want to have 28 billion dollars for the same time .
i just give you one .
it 's absurd . dark .
why do we do that ? why are we doing it ?
well , i think i understand that . we do the math .
we hate a zu , government . we do n't have trust in the system .
and we should n't . we do n't . we have health care system .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing and cold and selbst itself that we can do it .
so we 're going to go away where do we go ?
we 're in the street , the poor of the placebo-industrie .
that 's great . i love the placebo-industrie .
but , you know , it 's a really good thing to do , because that stuff is apple , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i 've got all kinds of pieces here .
no one -- gingko , betrug , betrug , betrug , betrug , betrug , i do n't even know what that 's , but we give billions of dollars for it , it 's betrug .
and do you know what ? if i say that , i 'm going to say , people say , and say , `` what do you do ? do n't care ? what do you want to do ?
that 's what you feel . ''
and guess what ? they have wrong .
because it does n't matter why it 's the gesundheitsminister , and says , `` hmm , i 'm not going to have the belege of my government to not mammographie '' or any krebs-quacksalber who wants to treat the patient with kaffe-einläufen kaffe-einläufen .
if you 're going to get on this path to believe and get creative and und and und , you get to a place where you do n't want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he gave me his mother of his reasons , because he was able to see that red beete and knoblauch and zitronenöl are much more powerful to antiretrovirale drugs drugs that we know that they can get the verlauf of aids .
tens of thousands of death in a country that 's worse than every other of this disease is geplagt .
do n't tell me that these things have no consequences .
that 's what they have . they have always .
now , the hirnloseste epidemic , where we 're only right now , this is struggle between struggle between gentechnisch gentechnisch food and bio-elite .
this is a idiotische debate . you have to stop .
it 's a debatte on words , talking about it .
that 's a child , not science .
all we eat , every single reiskorn , every single petersilie , every one is , , people will change from people .
you know , there is no mandarinen in the office .
there was no cantaloupe-melonen .
there was no weihnachtsbäume . we 've done it .
we 've done it in the last 11.000 years .
and some of them have done and some of them .
we 're losgeworden , which is n't working .
now we can make it more , and of course , there is , risks , but we do n't need a lot of vitamin a little bit , and that stuff can grow millions , people save people to live .
you do n't want to do that ?
i have to say , i do n't understand that .
we also have veränderte food .
why do we do it ?
now , what i 'm always talking about is : many people are , of course , hormone , pestizide , monokultur , we do n't want to have huge felder with them , and that 's wrong .
we do n't want to live lives .
we do n't want companies to grow seeds .
and you know , who 's on all this ?
yes , they 're right . let 's find that .
it 's true , we have a huge nahrungsproblem problem , but it 's not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , moral , patentkram .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , sometimes sometimes and sometimes , but the idea that we do n't allow science to do the work of it , because we fear fear is a real sackgasse , and it 's millions of millions of people
you know , in the next 50 years we have to have 70 percent more food . it 's about 70 percent .
this investment in africa , in the last 30 years .
beschämend . beschämend .
you need that , and we do n't give them one .
and why ? gentechnisch change food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this verrottete stuff as well .
maniok is something that has a billion billion people to eat .
it 's about a kartoffel .
it 's only a bunch of calories . it 's mies .
it does n't have any power , it does n't have any protein , and scientists have a few of them doing this .
and then people would eat it , and they would not be blind .
she would not be verhungern , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it would n't be chez , but it would be nice .
and everything i can say is : why are we going to fight this ?
i mean , let 's ask , why are we going to do that ?
because we do n't want any herumschieben genes ?
it 's not about genes genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our lächerliche passion for für , with food food , better food , einzigartiger food .
it 's not about rice krispies ; it 's about getting people to live , and it 's at the time time to understand what that means .
because do you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we do so , as far as we go , so we 're going to get to feel about it , i think we 're not supposed to be , , we 're not kolonialismus .
there is no other description for what 's happening here .
it 's selbstsüchtig , it 's ugly , it 's not our würdig , and we really have to stop it .
so after all this funny conversation , i 'd like to say , `` would you always be able to go into this ridiculous zeitmaschine and go to the future ? ''
no matter . that 's what i want to do .
it 's when it 's in the present moment , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can make this zeitmaschine on everything we want .
we can hinbewegen them , where we want them to do , and we 'll be going to move them up where we want .
we have to have this work , and we have to think , but if we go to the zeitmaschine and we go to the future , we will be happy to have the stuff .
i know that we can , and as far as i 'm concerned about it is something that 's going to get around the world .
thank you .
thank you .
i 've been interested in this way , for example . i think it might seem to be a strange way to make a sense of this , because it 's like me , `` one that i think , '' or `` i 'm sure that it 's
in other words , zuckerpillen have shown in a studies that have shown us in a global impact , the und , and it 's because the person who thinks what 's happening with you , is a pharmazeutische or a kind of -- or in a schmerzmanagement ,
it 's an illusion that 's a bit of a thing , because someone 's always going to be interested .
so we 're able to understand each other , and i want to show you a very , very zaubertrick , very simple .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that 's been at least in the zauberbuch at the zauberbuch of children .
i even saw him from the cub of the der scout der in the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for you , and then i 'm going to explain him .
and then i 'm going to explain why i 'm going to explain it .
so look , what happens .
the nervous that you can see ; my hand , you can see them .
i 'm just going to keep that myself in my pocket .
i 'm going to get out my ärmel .
and to make sure that in the meinem that i 'm going to go out of my ärmel , i 'm just going to go through here .
in this way , you can see that at any point , it does n't move anything . it 's like i 'm going to go back here , and i 'm able to do it in my shoes , or herauskommen .
and the goal is all about it .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully hopefully that if everything is good , it 's through my own körperlichen magnetismus .
it actually has a fest on its place that i can shake it without the ohne of the . .
nothing come in and out of your ärmel , and you get out of trickserei , and you can study everything .
ta-da !
well , this is a trick , which is often a little bit of kids who are trying to be kleinen , to be interested in zauberei , because you can kind of get a lot to know when you look at genauer , you know , when you
now , many of you know here in the room here is the trick .
it 's the way it works .
i think that is what i 'm going to be in my hand .
i say that i 'm going to umschließe to my mein , to make sure that there is nothing in the ärmel or come out , and that 's a lie .
the reason why i handgelenk my handgelenk is the point is that this is the secret of the illusion .
the point is that , if i look at my hand of them , you can see it in the front of the back , this is here , and this one here , this , , zeigefinger , just about where i was , in a position where
great trick ?
in the back , there 's someone who 's not kindheit .
so , it 's here .
and if i umdrehe my mind , the door is doing its position .
now , you might be talking about why this is an illusion , why not you do n't know how to do that , just to just take the first step out here : because the only thing and the way , the environment , and the way that
but this is not exactly what 's going on . and then i add my hand .
of course , it 's going to be shown , but not by the magnetismus of my body , but through a trick , with my zeigefinger , who is now there .
and when i take my hand , the same thing happens , i 'm going to start through this process , that i 'm going to get through the movement that i 'm going to get through the open .
i 'll take it hand . and here 's the knife .
the trick can give you the friends and some vorführen . thank you .
now , what did this do with the placebo-effekt ?
a year ago , as i said , i read a study that was really wirklich to me .
i 'm not a doctor or a doctor , and that 's why , because it was an important thing to me .
and what this means is , what if you think of a weißen , a white company , in a form of a in , is the only one , white white white , which is one particular messbaren effect .
but if you see the shape in which you have the placebo , for example , in a smaller leg , you see a little bit smaller , and then you see that blau , and you call it a little bit , and you call it a little
and it does n't even though any of those -- it 's just zuckerpillen .
but a white ball is not as good as a blue ball .
what ? what i did , i did really ausflippen .
but it turns out there is n't there .
if you take kapseln , that 's more likely to be even tabletten than anybody else .
so , a farbige that is a little bit at the end , yellow , and red is the red red , is better than a white .
also , the dosierung play .
a small five thousand days is not so good to read -- but i ca n't remember exactly exactly what 's happening . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... the thing -- the dosierungen <S> play .
and the shape is a matter .
and if you want to have ultimativen ultimativen , you 've got to be able to cross .
right ? a spritze with a wirkungslosen -- a few milliliter of a substanz phenomenon you can do with a patient .
it creates a very strong image in the head . it 's a lot more than a lot of weiße .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to show you a moment when we have a projektor .
so the fact is , the white ca n't make the sound of the blue video ball , the nicht of it does n't get a much like a kapsel that does n't make the sound like the foot .
and nothing of that is actually really eigenschaft in nature . it 's just our belief in which we have in a greater effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a zaubertrick .
i 'm going to do something which is obviously an institution , and it 's going to look at it .
we know that at the beginning of this , you 've got to be able to measure if you want to go to the point if it 's to go to it .
this is a 18 cm hutnadel . she 's very , very spitz . and i 'm going to get a little bit more sterilisieren .
this is really my meat . it 's not damians spezielles spezielles .
this is my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt from aus .
now i 'm going to put that in my skin in my skin , and i put it through the way down to the auf .
if you get to be -- if you 're in ohnmacht -- you can get a little bit of night at night , and some of you i did n't know , and that 's a woman that i was ohnmächtig .
so , i 'm going to try to make you feel very quickly , and look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i 'm going to do the first heiklen of heiklen in the back .
you can see it right now , but you also have wegsehen .
so , it 's like this , where my wave starts , i 'm going to start out to the bottom part of my arms , i 'm just going to make a little bit more einstich .
i 'm sorry sorry .
and just a little bit of some of the skin and my heraus page .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we had in beim .
it 's about it .
but now , do n't i do n't know my finger , is n't it ?
so , i 'll show you , that 's one , two , three , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , `` okay , the thing is not blöd , and durchsticht itself , and the skin itself , only to give us a few minutes . ''
well , i 'm going to show it to you .
how does that look like ? something good .
yes , i know .
and the people kept saying , `` okay . i do n't see that . ''
people in the in are coming in .
let me show you how much of you are .
this is my skin . this is not a spezialeffekt from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can herumdrehen it .
sorry . if you 're not going to look at it if you 're bad at it , you 're going to look at it .
the people , the ones , the ones that you see in the back once this time , once you see , you know , `` well , yeah , that 's pretty eindrucksvoll , but if it was real , it 's a hole , and there was
okay , let me make you a little bit for you .
yes , here it is .
now , i would now take you a little .
i would würde my arm , and show you that there are no wunden .
but i think in this context here , and with the intention of being a real thing , a little bit of a real life , i 'm going to go out and i 'm going to get out of the stage .
we 're going to live in some of the next days .
i hope you 've got very excited about it . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness .
i 've got some people who have been the number of books that are made in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there 's still much more .
there is a huge wave of the interesses of happiness among happiness .
there 's plenty of glücks-coaching .
everybody would love to do some hate .
but despite all of these flut , there are several cognitive processes that make it almost almost impossible , thinking about happiness .
and my talk today , most of these , is going to happen in the way .
and this is true of laien , which is thinking about your own happiness , and it 's for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we 're just so concerned about everybody else .
the first of these fall is a widerstreben , positive complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a physical word , because we use it in many different ways .
i think there is a particular meaning where we might be able to do it , but in the big and the thing that we have to do is , and we 'll be able to do the complicated process of what 's worth of it .
the second thing is a verwechslung of experience and memory : basically , it 's in between his life and his hands of his life , or happy to live with .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both zusammengeworfen in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the konzentrations-illusion , and that 's the most common fact that we ca n't be able to think of a situation , the well-being of being , without the meaning .
i mean , this is a social media .
there 's no one way to get it to do .
now , i 'd like to start with you an example of someone who has been a frage-und-antwort-sitzung for one of my employees who was a story .
and then he fügte , really , pretty emotional , that ruiniert ruiniert .
but it did n't .
what it was then was the memory of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music music .
she does n't stop because it was a erinnerung erinnerung ; it was memory , and the memory was everything he was going to get .
what we really tell you is that we might think about ourselves , and other people , we may be able to think about other people in the form of two species .
there 's a erlebendes self that lives in the present and the present knowledge , the way that it has to be true to us , but it 's the only way .
it 's the erlebende self , the doctor 's -- , you know , when the question says , `` well , when it does it go , do i put it ? ''
and then there 's a erinnerndes self , and the erinnernde self is the das , and the story of our life is erhält , and it 's dasjenige , the ist is indem by the question , `` the question is , `` how did you feel in
or , was it going to get a journey ? how would you get to get it ? or , like that .
this is two very different pieces of das , and even erlebende itself and erinnernde the erinnernde self , and the two things that are part of the des of happiness is happiness .
well , the erinnernde self is a geschichtenerzähler .
and this is what happens to be the response response to our memories , it starts to look at it .
we 're not just stories that if we 're going to tell ourselves to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is to tell us what we need to continue to be in a story .
and let 's start with an example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients which schmerzhaften a lot of . schmerzhaften .
i 'm not going to go into detail . it 's not a little bit of fun , but it was painful , this was a schmerzhaft event in the 1990s .
they were asked to be alle for their parents .
and here are two patients . these are their aufzeichnungen .
and they said , `` who 's got more ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b is eindeutig more . darmspiegelung , more than more , and at least a minute of pain , the patient 's a gift was a new b , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how did i think these patients were they litten ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is , for a great , a viel an of the darmspiegelung had a b b .
the stories of the darmspiegelungen were different , and because of a very important part of the story is how it ends up .
and none of these stories is very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is that clearly .
but one of them is clear worse than others .
and the worse , even worse where the pain was at the end of his pain . it was a terrible story .
how do we know it ?
because we asked people to ask their ihrer gefragt , and a lot later , `` how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a b than for a b in erinnrung .
well , this is a direkter conflict between the erlebenden self and the erinnernden itself .
from the erlebenden self , a eindeutig is a eindeutig time .
now , what you could do with the patient a day , and we actually have started experiments with a lot of experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually be able to put the patient 's verlängern by simply using the
that will lead the patient that the aber is , but just a little bit less less than before .
and if you do it for a few minutes , you 've got a chance to be a bad way of your own person , and you have the idea that the erinnernde self of a much better way is a little better way to do , because now
what is a story ?
and the reason that stories for the stories that works of us , and it 's also the same for us with the stories we 've made .
and what a story is a story of auszeichnet , umbrüche , bedeutende and enden .
so , very important , very , very important , very important in the case .
now , the self itself will live its lives .
it has augenblicke 's des , one of the other .
and they say , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . it 's lost forever .
i mean , most of our augenblicke of life -- -- and i think this is -- you know , the present present is about three seconds as three as well , which means , you know , it 's been about millions million of it , in a
most of them will be completely ignoriert from erinnernden .
and yet , they get a sense that what they 're important is that what happens in the augenblicke of the erlebens is our life .
it 's the kind of resource that we use while we are in the world .
and as we might want them , they 're very important , but that 's not the story that behält the erinnernde self for us .
so we have the erinnernde self , and the erlebende self , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the way you have time .
from the perspective of self , if you have a meeting , you know , and the second week , i think the first thing is so good for the first one , and then it 's twice as long as it is a urlaub .
this is n't how much works for the erinnernde self .
for the erinnernde self , a zweiwöchiger joke is a lot more difficult than the einwöchige urlaub , because there are no new memory going to make it .
they have n't changed the story .
and in this way , time , there 's a critical point that a erinnerndes self is different from a erlebenden self . time , it 's very different impact on this story .
now , the erinnernde self makes more than just to remember stories .
it 's actually dasjenige , it makes you , because if you have a patient who is , if we asked a patient , we say , two people who had two different chirurgen , and who would be able to vote , then the one of the people
the erlebende self has no voice in the election .
in fact , we do n't choose between erlebnissen . we choose between memory of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't usually think about our future .
we think about our future after vorausgesehene memories .
and basically , you can see that as well , as you know , as a tyrannei of the erinnernden itself , and you can think of that as an example of the object as a sense of the object , as the selbst of the sozusagen , the
i have the idea that when we make paper , it 's a very strange thing , which is , we 're going to go through the dienste of the self .
and this is a little hard to get , i think .
i mean , how much do we use our memories ?
this is one of the reasons that the gegeben of the erinnernden self is given .
and if i think about it , i think of a meeting , which has made a few years ago in nature , which is clear of the best conference that i 've ever been doing , and i often are often a lot of it in the way
and i would probably look at my memories , and i would say , about this memory journey , i would say , about 25 minutes , i would say , about four years .
now , if i had to open the ordner , i would see pictures of the photographs of images , i would have another week .
well , these are three weeks , and this is höchstens minutes of hours .
there seems to be a unstimmigkeit scheint .
now , i like to be a little bit , you know , like , how little appetit i 've been working on the zehren of memory , but even even if they make more of that , why do we feel so much weight ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
imagine your next lesson , you know that you 're all the end of the first part of your pictures , and you get a amnestisches drugs , so that you 're not going to remember .
well , would you choose the same gentleman ?
and if you were going to pick a time on a es , there is a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and it 's actually not obvious , because it 's a response to
why we get the answer that we 're saying is a problem that makes us feel a choice between the two species of self .
well , the two species of the brain is put two words on the happiness .
in fact , there are two concepts of happiness that we can use , one is one .
so you can ask yourself , how happy is the self ?
and then they would ask , how happy are the augenblicke in life in the life of the self themselves ?
and they 're all -- happiness , glück , is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be gemessen ?
and , by the way , we 're now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness of the time of the erlebenden self itself .
if you ask yourself , the happiness of happiness is a very different thing .
this is not about your mother 's person .
it 's about the sound that is , like , or is the person being , is that person is the person when the person person thinks about life .
very different .
everybody who does n't think that this particular thing is going to be vermasseln to the ich of happiness , and i 'm gehöre to a lot of learning about the world that has been designing for a long time to have a long time
the distinction between happiness and the self itself has been given the last decade of life has been discovered in the last few years , and now it 's going to be able to measure the two separat .
die gallup has a number of years where more than a few people have been asked to be a number of people about what they think about their lives and talk about their experiences . and they have other ideas in the direction .
so , in the last few years , we 've started to learn about happiness in both of the other species of self .
and the most lesson lesson , i think , is that i think that they 're really different .
you can know how bad somebody has his life , and it does n't tell you a lot about how happy he 's alive to life , and also .
just to give you a sense of the korrelation , the korrelation is just .5 .
so what that means is that if you had somebody , and you would say , `` oh , your father is a zwei-meter-mann , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you 'd know something about this size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody is going to be a story when a half zehn on a scale of 10 times a eingeordnet eingeordnet , it has a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his erlebenden themselves .
so the korrelation is small .
we know something about what makes the des of zufriedenheit .
we know that money is a very important thing to do is , of course .
we know that happiness is actually means that with speech with people who we like , is time to spend with people who like .
there are other people , but this is dominant .
so , if you want to be the happiness of the species of the form of the brain , they will be very much about everything .
and the idea that i 'm talking about here is that we 're not really interested in an architect as a ersatz for well-being .
it 's a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason that we do n't realize about happiness is that we 're not going to think of the same things that we think about our lives , and if we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question as happy as people are in california , you 're not going to be the right answer .
so if you think about this question , people are going to be happier in california , if you 're saying , in life .
and what 's happened is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that is a difference , and we have a difference in the climate .
well , it turns out , climate change is very important to the erlebende self , and it 's not even very important for the nachdenkliche self , which is , happy happy .
now , because the nachdenkliche self is responsible for you , you can get a few people in the end of california .
and it 's kind of interesting , and what 's happened to people who are talking about california , who is hope to hope .
now , your selbst is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you 'll think they 're happy , because if you think about it , you 're going to see it , how terrible the weather is in ohio , and you 'll feel that you have the right decision .
it 's very difficult to find out of thinking about well-being , and i hope that i have a sense of this kind of schwierig , which is it difficult .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
now , when we had a few weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that was taken out of this gallup umfrage .
is that something that we can do with me , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the denke of the things that we 've seen in front of the umfrage is a number that we have n't really have to discover .
we found this in terms of the erlebenden self .
when we look at how to make emotions .
and it turns out that a mile of 60.000 dollars a year , for americans , and that 's a very large stichprobe of americans , and it 's a very large stichprobe of americans , and 600.000 , it 's a big big stichprobe , under a einkommen
60.000 .
dk : 93 .
3,000 dollars a year , people will be happy , and they become increasingly increasingly unglücklicher , they will be ärmer .
this is where we 're going to go through that .
i mean , i saw half of the lines out on the lines .
what 's happening is obvious , and that one thing that you have to do is a beschafft , but a lack of lack of money is a elend , and we can actually mangel this .
in the sense of other other self , the erinnernden self , you get another story .
the more money you need to do is the man of the verdient .
it 's not true emotion .
but danny , in the entire american bestreben , it 's about living , freedom to be streben .
when people take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems everything to make it right , everything that we believe in , for instance , to steuerpolitik and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country would find a befund like a ernst , and to deal with it in terms of poverty ?
dk : you know , i think that there is a role of the glücksforschung of the glücksforschung in the glücksforschung .
and the will become slow to the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it happens , it 's in the united states .
the people are clear , they know that they should be good at least when they think of poverty .
it 's going to be a while , and people will be wondering about whether they 're going to be able to study erlebnis-glück , or whether they want to study lebens-bewertung , so we have to start to get this discussion soon .
how you can predict happiness , a lot of attention to you about how you think , and you think of thinking about yourself , or whether you think about yourself .
that 's going to affect politics , i think , in the back .
in the united states , they were strengt to measure the erlebnis-glück of the population .
that 's where i think , in the next one or two , what we 're going to be here will be the national scale .
well , it seems to me , and i 'm going to do this topic , or if i 'm at least , the interessanteste political goals has to be a debatte part of the next few years .
thank you very much .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i 'm a mcgonigal mcgonigal . i 'm playing video games .
i 've been entwickle for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to be easy to make the world in reality in the reality of how it is in online-spielen .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people to get more of them more than playing and more and more games .
now , let 's go three hours a week with online-spielen .
some of you might think of , `` that 's a lot of time for games . ''
maybe something about a lot of time when we think about how we solve a lot of problems in the real world .
but in fact , i 'm going to talk about the research on the future is the exact same thing .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the world 's problems in the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to take the next century on this planet , we have to continue to move this time .
i 've been able to spend a lot of time at time , that we have spent 25 billion billion dollars for a year .
this might be something that 's going to be a little bit more , so i 'll try to make it : if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , climate change , and certainly , i think we can try to do video
no , i do really want to .
why ? this picture is pretty straightforward , why i think that games is so powerful to the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a porträt of the fotografen phil .
he wanted to make the feelings of play , so he would have a camera out of the players .
this is one of the classic examples of play .
if you 're not a player , maybe some of you might get some of the nuancen in this picture .
you probably hear this sense of urgency , something which is fear , but also konzentration konzentration , vertieft vertieft in the real difficult difficult .
if you play games , you see a nuancen nuancen , which is the top of the left , and the mouth are a sign of optimism , the augenbrauen show him .
this is a robot that rande on the edge of a brain epischen .
oh , you know that . okay . so we 've got some players here .
a epischer sieg is a result which is so much positive , that they did n't know it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , you 're shocked that they 're actually going to be involved in this . this is a epischer sieg .
this player is just about a sieg sieg .
and this is what we need to look at millions of millions of people in the world , if we take the hürden of the next century , the face of which the entgegen are entgegen at the one of a epischen sieges .
well , unfortunately , unfortunately , we 're going to see more about this face in the real life , if we 're very difficult to speak .
i call it as a `` i live in life , '' and i 'm in my face , see , and it 's my face , right ? ok ?
this is me , as i said , `` i live it in life . ''
this is a graffiti in my ehemaligen home in california , california , where i 'm on my right now , why we 're trying to look better in the real life .
this is a problem that many people have a lot of players .
we think that we do n't actually feel that well as good in games .
and i do n't mean much less , although that 's one of them .
we 're in spielwelten . we mean , i 'm good at the time , and i 'm talking about the solution of the kind of thing that 's going to do with a bedeutsames , a lot of collaboration .
if we are in a spielwelt , i think that many of us will be able to turn into our best version , even better , and sofort , the problem is to solve the problem that we need to try to try to take it to
and in reality , if we fail , when we 're on wenn , we often feel differently .
we feel ourselves . we feel guilty . we feel bedroht , we feel bedroht , perhaps , or zynisch .
we do n't feel that if we do play games , you 're not just going to be able to play it .
and that 's what i wanted to study .
why is it possible in games , you think , you ca n't get to anything ?
how can we make emotions feel out of the reality ?
so i looked at games like this , of warcraft , of the ideale environment , which was able to bietet the ideale environment .
and i discovered some things that epische epische in in online-welten .
so , first of all , if you go to one of these online-spiele , especially to the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters that are willing to anzuvertrauen you .
but not only is a mission , but it 's a perfect thing that does perfect to the right , in the game , is n't it .
so , you can do it .
they do n't get a job they do n't solve .
but always on the side of your ability , so you have to work . but there is no arbeitslosigkeit in the world of hell .
you 're not sitting around and you 're dreht . there 's always a real thing to do .
and there are haufenweise employees .
where you go to hundreds , hundreds of thousands of people who are working on to do their own mission .
we do n't just have that simple , but it feels that feeling like a fingerschnipsen haufenweise mitarbeiter .
also , there 's this kind of history story , which is , to tell us what we think we are and what we have .
then we have this whole positive feedback .
they have bestimmt , which is the level , and `` stärke 's '' or `` intelligenz intelligence . ''
this konstante feedback does n't exist in real life .
if i 'm doing this stage , i 'm not talking about +1 sprechen and verrückte idea , +20 crazy idea .
i still do n't have to tell the feedback in this life .
so , the problem of warcraft , like , of course , is that it 's so befriedigend , is that it 's so befriedigend , is to be jederzeit at the moment of a epischen sieges that we 're going to spend our time at time .
they 're just better than reality .
so , today , in the world , all of the cities , warcraft-spieler million 5,93 million people have been working with the virtuellen problems .
it 's not necessarily a little bit bad .
it sounds sounds bad .
but just to see it in the context of the world , millions of years ago , we started to ersten our first primatenvorfahren .
so the first aufrechte primat .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend , we start with a lot of time , with a little bit of time , that 's a little bit of sense when you have time in the way that you 're going to talk about
but it 's true . because it turns out that we 're using the whole time of what we 're doing right now , that we are changing the way that we 're in the position .
we 're moving to develop some gemeinschaftlich , herzlichen creatures .
that 's the truth . this is what i believe .
now , if you look at this interesting statistics , which was a kürzlich inspired by a study of carnegie university , which is , the young young man in the world 's high school , 10.000 hours of 10.000 every year with four years .
so , 10,000 times more powerful is a very interesting number two years .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10.080 10.080 are the same gesamtzeit that they spend in the morning for the age of high school .
so here we have a parallelbildungsweg parallelbildungsweg , which is the people who tell people how to think of it , a good player , like all of you who learn to school .
and maybe some of them have the new book of malcolm gladwell , überflieger überflieger , read .
so , you know the des of the success , the theory of the success of the patient 's second hours .
it 's based on the great research of kognitivwissenschaft , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the mit of beliebigen , we 're going to have to deal with the 21st century .
we 're going to be so good to do whatever the most people in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are meister-spieler .
so the big question is , `` well , are we going to have a meisterhaft meisterhaft ? ''
because if we could find this , we would never have any of our menschliches problems as well .
so many people , we have a number of people in the world who spend at least an hour of four hours a day .
this is our meister-spieler , 500 million people who are extraordinary gut in something .
and the next decade , we have another billion players , which is a very good one , which is a lot of a lot .
if you have n't heard about it .
the spieleindustrie developed to konsolen the energy and save energy and mobilfunknetzen it , instead of all the world , in particular world , in india , in india .
you 're going to have a different billion people in the past decade .
so we 've got billions of thousand people .
so i started to think , what it is , what this games will do is to make these games .
here are the four things i found .
ok , imagine what it 's like extreme selbstmotivierung .
dringlichkeits-optimismus is the desire to actually make something that we have to be a hürde , zusammen with faith , that we have a hope of hope .
players always believe that a epischer is possible possible , and it 's always about to get it , it 's the same .
players do n't have to get around .
players are the meister of the dichter .
there 's a lot of interesting research that show that we can look at people like that , as we were playing with them , even though they have übel .
the reason for that is that there 's a lot of trust to someone with a game .
we can trust that somebody jemand with us that the rules will be dass that we have the same target and the end to the spielende .
so the zusammenspielen allows that to grow and von and miteinander .
as a result of that , we 're going to be social social relationships .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
you know , there is one reason why the durchschnitts-word of warcraft-spieler spielt year a week , as a teilzeitjob .
the reason is that if we 're playing , we actually are n't happy to work hard , if we 're talking or not .
we know that as we speak , we 're going to be optimal as human beings , if we do hard , it 's work .
and players are always ready to work , hard , they 're going to get the right thing .
and finally , epische meaning .
players like me to be teil missionen missionen .
here 's a hintergrundinformation in order to rücken the rechte light . you know , all of wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second wiki of the world , with nearly 80.000 einträgen , is the world of . .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet , as part of the other zusammengetragen in the world 's most important world .
they create a epische story .
they create a epische source of knowledge of the world of warcraft .
okay , so these are four of the die that are going to be a very human outcome . robots are super-mächtige , really , individuals .
it 's people who believe that they can change the existence of the world .
and the only problem is that they think they can change the virtual worlds , but they do n't change the real world .
this is the problem i 'm trying to solve .
edward edward is a volkswissenschaftler .
his work is a great thing . he 's like , why people often spend a lot of energy and money .
and he says , `` we will not be zeugen of any less than any kind of physical worlds in virtual worlds . ''
and this is a ökonom . so it 's logisch .
and he says ...
not like i -- i 'm playing games , i 'm etwas .
so he says that this is actually makes sense , because the players can be more and more like more than they are in real life .
they can be better social and knüpfen in their lives as they live in real life , and they get more and more and more vulnerable to play in the real life .
so , he says , it 's a sense of vollkommen , which is that a lot of time in the virtual world is much more time in the virtual world .
i 'm just going to start to get it out .
but it 's certainly not a optimalsituation .
we need to start to make the world in the game world .
my inspiration comes from one of the event , for instance , 2.500 years .
there are those antiken würfel , schafsknöcheln schafsknöcheln . you know ?
before these fantastic spielecontrollern , there were schafsknöchel .
and that 's the first time when people were sozusagen .
and if you 're talking about the griechischen of the ancient familiar , you know , you may have heard this story . the story of it , how it 's done .
according to spiele , games are actually going to work in würfelspiele , in the middle world , lydien erfunden .
otherwise , there was such such a lot of hungersnot that the king of lydien sich sich to a idea .
the people who are . people who are kämpften .
it was an extraordinary situation . you took an enormous solution .
so they invented , laut the das and the eine and a nationale strategy , and then you would eat food .
and you would be so good into the würfelspiel vertieft , and you 're going to be so amazing and uns with produktivität , you know that it was not going to be safe .
and then , the next thing you would play is , the next day you would eat .
and laut laut , she used to make this week for 18 years , taken up a year , and at the next time .
in the same way , i 'm going to give you today .
we 're playing games to play , to look at the suffering of the real world .
we 're going to play games , to really expect everything that does n't work in the real world , especially that it is not befriedigend , and we 're going to take out what we need for the games .
but it does n't have to be the end .
that 's the moment .
according to 18 years , the hungersnot did n't better .
they created the course of two .
they played in a und and they were able to have a sieger of durften to a epischen research .
they went out and they auf the way after a new home . he did n't spend so much people , how we had all over and over the world , and they were able to
that sounds crazy , right ?
but neueste dna-beweise shows that the etrusker that später later römische the römische -- the same dna as the old lydier .
so , recently , a recently recently , in general , is that verrückte is actually very good story .
and geologen has found the idea of a global abkühlung , which has been nearly 20 years of what we 've seen .
so , this crazy story , man .
you might actually have people in their games by playing their own friends with 18 years , and they had these eingebung and und and so much about the miteinander that they would have been able to share the whole civilization .
so that 's what we can do .
we 're working on a lot of 1994 .
this was the first strategiespiel in real real world of warcraft-serie . this was 16 years ago .
she used to 18 18 years , and i was playing for 16 years of jahren .
i do n't know , we 're willing for our own personal episches .
so , they took the half of their civilization to look for a new world . so i 'm going to take my 21 billion spielstunden per week .
we should be able to do that for a half , a half of us gave us an hour per day every day we 've done problems of the world .
i know you 're going to ask you , `` how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? '' and , in fact , i 'm going to do the problems in the last few years of the center of the project .
we 've got this in our office in our office in palo büro , it 's drückt out how we understand the future .
we do n't want to try and say the future before .
what we want to do is to make the future .
we want to introduce the most important thing . and then people menschen us to make this idea in reality .
we stellen epische siege , and we give the people to be able to achieve them .
let me show you a few quick steps i 'll show you , to try to try and make people more verschaffen .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a online-spiel , , where you have to have an überwinden überwinden .
the ölknappheit is invented , but we 've got enough to do it 's because it 's realistisch , and when it comes to spiel , it 's when you live in it , and then you get
we 've done this game with 1.700 players in 2007 . and we 've got it already over the three three years .
and i can tell you , it was a kind of experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment , or it should be .
but if you 're in the epischen , and you 'll say , `` we 're going to get out of oil . ''
this is an amazing thing that you will go .
find out how they would survive survive , most of our spieler have the die in play .
so , we started to ask a little bit of the future , and we have a chance to do , and , when we have a größeres , it was about höheres .
we have the game `` superstruct '' in the center for the future .
so , at the end of the way , one of the supercomputers is that people have only been on the planet .
this is called `` global aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system , '' of course .
the sound of players , anzumelden , we 've almost almost like einen a einen jerry-bruckheimer .
you know about jerry kennen , where it 's the dream-team . it 's the astronauten , the scientists , the ex-sträfling , and only they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , say , every one of the dream-team is und , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social media .
in fact , spiel players would play the game of eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly powerful solutions that they could nachlesen if they were superstruct .
and the last game is going to go out to three percent , it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
if you end up with the game , you will be von by the world of `` social , '' by 2010 .
we 're working in india , and we 're going to try to make social umgestalten .
we have an comic on it . we 've got a hoch on the ground , and we have the idea of regionales , high , sustainability , vision and vision .
i want to invite you to share this game with young people everywhere in the world in most of the world , because in which entwicklungsgebieten , they have their own social jobs to help the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think , next ?
we 've got all these amazing players , we 're playing with us to show what we can do , but we have n't seen the real world .
well , i hope that they 're telling me that if you 're afraid , if you 're the other person , the best resources we can use for the real life , and the games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superkräfte , glückselige productivity , the ability to slow social social networks , dringlichkeits-optimismus and verlangen for nach meaning .
i 'm hoping that we 're going to do play in a lot of games games for a planet to another century .
and i hope you will play with design and play .
if i 'm going to go back to the next decade , i 'm sure i 'm going to be two things that we can create all the future future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let 's start with the weltverändernden games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something about me , a few weeks ago that i 've been writing about an wired für .
i always read my blog griffbereit , but i was there , and i was going to have the bearbeiten of the fertig , and i realized that i had never seen my life in the life of what the word ``
i 'll show you the one .
`` behindert , '' adjektiv : `` , hilflos , nutzlos , zerstört , zerstört , verstümmelt , verwundet , zugerichtet , lahm , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , gelähmt , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe , siehe
antonyme : healthy , strong , strong , stark . ''
and i would look at this list of a friend , and i wanted to see it , and it was so obvious , but it was just until bis , and i did n't have mehr , and i could n't sammeln it up , and i had
of course , this was a ausgefranstes , old synonym-wörterbuch , and i just thought that the ausgabe had to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a writing on the early age , and i was just grundschule with school , and i started to get my selbstbild outside of my familiären umfelds , and i was able to use my own außerhalb of my familiären umfelds , and
and god is not so much i used to do that .
if i was going to take that seriously seriously , i would be born in a world that someone would like me as a person who would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
so i immediately went to the online-ausgabe of 2009 , and i decided to make an ansprechenderen on the place .
here 's the aktualisierte version of this eintrags .
dummerweise is not much better .
in particular , most of the most wörter words under the wörter `` unter , '' `` ganz . ''
but it 's not just about words .
it 's what we think about the people who we think about these words .
it 's about the values that are put in these words , and how we create these values .
our language depends on our way of thinking , and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of altertümliche societies , including the griechen and the römer , have believed that the aussprache of a fluchs is a big force , because what you 're going to hear is to be able to manifestieren .
so , what do we actually want to do -- a behinderten people or a kraftvollen people ?
just a way of being achtlos as a child as a child , could be ausreichen , sie them and ihnen them .
would n't it be nice to be able to leave it to the text ?
a person who has been türen for me , was kinderarzt my mein at the a.i . dupont institut in wilmington .
he 's called dr. pizzutillo . ein italo-amerikaner , who says , `` you can not know , americans do n't even know , but he 's always dr. the p. .
and dr. p. trug took a very bunte bunte , and was working with the work with children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital hospital , just great -- to the physiotherapie .
i had to make individual übungen , often , i 've always had a lot of times , with bändern dicken -- in various colors -- i know you can do my own kind of work . i 'm going to get it out . i
and imagine that i had , as a fünfjähriges child with dr. p. verhandelt and so trying to stop those übungen , natürllich ohne .
and one day he looked at me and one of my übungen -- -- these were only ermüdend and und -- and he said , `` wow , aimee , you 're a strong , kraftvolles and young girl , you know , one of the bänder
and if you can make it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
this was , of course , was just a simple trick , dr. p. , who i 'm trying to do that , i did n't want to , in fact , that the fünfjährige would be mädchen to the mädchen in the second floor , but he actually
and i wonder , `` well , what i 've like to do , as a sense of my vision , as a und and kraftvolles young girl has been mädchen my geformt and i 've been able to see from one of the way of nature and starken
this is just one example of many , many times , as adults as a child to help the patient 's child .
but as soon as you know about some examples of lässt synonym-wörterbüchern , we do n't have our own power to make a difference , which is to figure out what we all would like to make : to every single individual , to imagine people as kraftvollen people
our language was den the change in which that many of them have been created by a change change .
now , i think of this medizinischen talk , of course , my legs , the laser-chirurgie of sehbehinderungen , kniegelenke of titan and künstliche hüftgelenke for alternde bodies that allow people to actually menschen their opportunities , hinaus , social , they 're going to have a different
so perhaps this particular change is that , in fact , that there was always a truth that there was always a truth that there was always a person who could be able to be able to share with the fact that they could share a lot of the
the human ability to make -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you about how i play with und , and i 'm going to tell you a question that this sentence has never been mich me , and i think i
this sentence that this has to do with widrigkeiten is about the success of happiness and happiness and to be a challenge to be involved with the experience of the experience of the experience , and experience the same thing .
but the truth is that we can change . of course , we are , of course , is to challenge , to whether it 's physically , and even in both the other ways .
and i 'm going to do that .
widrigkeiten are not a hindernis that we have to have to be able to think of our lives better .
widrigkeiten is simply just about our lives .
and i tend to be as as i can see as a als .
sometimes i know that it 's very präsent , sometimes it 's almost to see , but it 's always in me .
and i want to end up with the power of the way .
there are widrigkeiten and involved in life , and the only are alllzu real real life , and each person is different from each other . but the question is , whether it 's not about whether we 're already klar or oder , but
so we 're not just responsible for the people who are trying to keep people out of schicksalsschlägen , but they also want to work to get good at that .
and we do n't take our kids if we give them a sense that they ca n't touch it .
you 've got to two things to say , you know , one of the most successful fact that i had to do with the medizinische of this , of the amputiert , or the way of thinking about the brain itself , if it 's not a oder
and to be honest honest , the only real and most behinderung that i have to get to you is that the world is always thinking , and you can describe me with this text .
in our desire to protect people to people who are uns to us , to the extent , the truth of the truth , the truth of the medical prognose , or even an prognose of the quality of life that they 're trying to do , is
maybe the momentane concept concept , just the darauf of what 's in a kaputt , and what we 're doing is , for every single fact , a greater behinderung than the pathologie .
if we do n't treat a ganzheitlich ganzheitlich , and all of the forces and not wahrnehmen all the forces and look at all , and then we can actually be able to fight the natural struggle that you might need to have a disease
we degradieren a people who has a value for our society .
so we need to look at the patologie , and we 're going to focus on all of the human possibilities of our own needs .
but in the am , it 's between the perception of our unzulänglichkeiten and our big erfindergeist , a connection .
we should n't be able to do this herausfordernden times as verleugnen , or verleugnen , we should not try to avoid it , but we should not be sie them with the teppich , but it 's about to see the chancen changes .
it may seem to me , it 's clear that we have to have widrigkeiten widrigkeiten , because that we 're open to widrigkeiten , we 're going to be open to packen them at the sie , to give them an und and even
and maybe we 're es widrigkeiten as a natural natural natural , natural and natural , and nützliches us uns away from their presence .
in this year , we send the second one of the second , darwin of charles , and when he heard about 30 years ago about evolution , darwin darwin in the eyes , the darwin , it 's been sehr in human history .
i 'd like it as a : : not the most of his species , but not the intelligenteste of its type , but the fact that could change the role of the changes .
there is natural selection .
not just from the work , we know that the ability of people who survive and survive , from the fight of human nature , is sich with durch .
so , again , change and these are the whole skills of people .
and maybe we know only , we 're geschnitzt , we 're going to be geschnitzt , if we 're being geprüft .
it 's just the idea of widrigkeiten , a sense of ichs , a sense of our own power .
we can get ourselves a bit like ourselves .
we can give a new meaning , which is a very important thing , more difficult times .
we may be able to see veränderung change .
widrigkeiten is about a change that we have n't angepasst on .
i think the greatest rule we have ourselves ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
oh , who 's normal ?
there is no oil .
there are the übliche . the typische is . it 's not the normal . and would you like these guys , you know , if you were to know ?
i think it 's not .
it would be great if we were doing this dieses of the gegen against one other person and the strength , and it could even be able to be able to be able to be able to say , so we can use the forces of the
anthropolgen have found that we have always menschen from the group of our society always eines , meaning useful , to make a beitrag .
there are evidence that there 's been a neandertaler that 60.000 years ago , and there were people that were given people who have been körperlichen people who have done with people who have been verletzungen with getragen , and they 've done the same thing with the überlebenskampf
they do n't have people as a kaputt and a nutzlos ; they were treated as something and useful .
a few years ago , i was in the city where i was growing in a lebensmittelmarkt in the red circle in the rise of pennsylvania , and i was there in a tomaten .
it was summer , summer , and i had shorts an .
and i 'm like , like , a guy behind me , if i do n't know , `` oh , if it 's not aimee mullins . ''
and i dreh around and i could see that man . i had no idea who he was .
and i said , `` well , sir , do you know me ? i ca n't remember it .
and he said , `` well , you do n't even know me . ''
when i saw them , i used to be bauch from her mother .
oh , so that .
and of course , it has done klick .
this was dr. kean , a man who just heard me from stories of my mother over the day because i knew , of course , in my birthday , two weeks ago .
the doctor 's pränatale diagnostik of my mother was at stanford , and so my parents had the man who got me to the world , not .
and because i was born in wadenbeine , and my feet came up to you , and i just put a couple of them on this room , and i saw a couple of letters on the other foot , and it 's a überbringer der , and that
he said to me , `` i had to tell her parents that i would never walk , and never as beweglich as the children , or not just have a unabhängiges life , and i just have just lügen myself . ''
but i was really surprised to find that he 's been zeitungsausschnitte zeitungsausschnitte of my entire childhood , whether it was at the buchstabier-wettbewerb grade in the second six years , if i was at the pfadfindern of the unterwegs at the klasse , if he was at the
and he called this part of his kurses den , the potential of the human willens .
you ca n't just have enough betonen how to this point of the quality of a human being .
and dr. kean said he said , `` i have already learned that kids do n't tell you another thing , and if you 're not going to get a little bit , if you have children , you can get a lot of people , you can get
you know , dr. hat 's changed .
he had understood that the medical condition , and as someone like that , two different things .
and also , my thinking about time , if i wanted to ask , if i asked people to be 15 years , when i was asked my prothesen , i would have no way to read my prothesen and meat , and then i would have a sekunde
i did n't want to be in the same time .
if you ask me that today , i 'm not quite sure .
and this is what i 've done with you , my legs , and i do n't have to experience that .
and maybe this changes could be , because i have so many people who have open up , instead of having to give me a happy to me .
look , it 's just one of the people who have to show you how they can be able to manifestieren their forces .
if you 're able to make it , your own body , to make forces , – your life , the human spirit is so empfangsbereit -- if you do this , and for someone in your own moment , it 's a very good teacher .
they bring them to open up .
the real meaning of `` worts '' wurzelt in the word `` educe . ''
it means that something that is in a field is the potential for potential .
again , how could we want to pay attention ?
in the '60s , in britain , in the 1950s , gymnasien had been fallstudie in umgewandelt .
they call it there , `` streaming trials '' in the u.s. , we call it as `` tracking . ''
the students will get rid of that .
and the fifth government is going to get out more serious , and it 's also a teacher teacher .
and then they started talking about a dreimonatigen period of students , which is a great ausreichend , which is a great good job , and they said to them , they were very smart , they were very smart . and they came up with these three months
and of course , zerbricht it to the heart that the umgekehrt said said , `` i 'm not enough .
and the same thing was , after the three months .
but only those who have been in high school -- except for the students who had geschmissen school .
the key thing about this research was that the teachers were not eingeweiht .
the teachers did n't know that they were changed .
they just said that the einser-schüler and the sind are the schüler and the ones that they have with the ausreichend is there . they also have the same ones that they do .
the only real life is a gebrochener mind that 's a mind that 's a broken der , a lot of , does n't have hope , it does n't feel beautiful . it 's not going to be our beautiful , kindliche curiosity about it ,
but if we create the way to help the human spirit , we should continue to be able to find out and other people to think about , we have to be curious , `` well , we 're going to really change our
if a mind about these values , we can create a new reality and new daseinsformen .
i 'd like to end with a poem that von by a einem persischen called the im century 14 , and the daughter said , `` my god , '' god says , `` the child , ''
come with me . thank you very much .
